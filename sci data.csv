1,Inception,2010,PG-13,2h 28min,Action; Adventure; Sci-Fi; ,16 July 2010 (USA),8.8,1981688,3820,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/reviews/_ajax?ref_=undefined&paginationKey=,https://resizing.flixster.com/8X8J8sNXmCWDBaxo3vueONLRj00=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p7825626_p_v8_af.jpg,8,Amazingly original...but also a bit overwhelming.,02-Dec-10,"This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important  as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this.As for the movie  I'll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It's just not the sort of movie I'd usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did  however  as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First  the story is wildly original (though  also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films  I can't think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second  the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing  totally amazing  special effects. Third  it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in ""Titanic""--his maturity and grit were welcome. Also  seeing the kid from ""Third Rock"" suddenly playing an action hero was great--you'd barely recognize him--or the other grown child actors. Fourth  I loved the ending--it really pulled everything together very well.So why am I not giving the film a glowing review? Well  I am simply not an action film fan. And  the insane pace  TONS of shooting and crazy plot simply lost me at times. I much preferred the slower and more introspective moments of the film. Also  while Ken Watanabe is a fine actor  I had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he said--to the point where I wish they'd either dubbed him or had caption! Now this is NOT just because I am an old crank who is slightly hard of hearing--my daughter  too  found his thick accent difficult. On the other hand  Ms. Cotillard was VERY easy to understand and I was surprised how well she controlled her lovely French accent.I could probably go on and on about the film--as it's long  complex and VERY prone to be one to watch and re-watch and discuss with friends. However  at this point  there are already a bazillion reviews and 7 billion people have already gone to see it  so I'll call it a day.Well worth seeing....but perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many.",positive

After seeing it for myself  I thought it was a good film  but not as good as I was led to believe. Out of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen  Inception didn't wow me as much as Memento and The Prestige  and it is one of my least favourites of his so far. Does that mean the film is bad? No  I am just saying I do not think it is Nolan's best as I have heard people say.My main problem with Inception was the lack of emotional attachment  I do understand completely anybody who says it is emotionally cold. Particularly in the characters  they are written and acted well  but not much is done to make us empathise with them and their predicaments. I loved the idea of the story  it was clever and somewhat original and it did start very compelling and intriguing  but as the film progresses it does become rather convoluted and I found myself losing a little interest. Also  the pace is uneven  as the characters became more cold and the story more convoluted  the film really does start to drag until the conclusion where the film does thankfully pick up.Inception despite these faults does have a number of strengths  especially the beautifully crafted production values  dream sequences and effects and Nolan's superb direction. Hans Zimmer's score is incredibly good too  while powerful and haunting it rarely becomes overbearing  while the dialogue is on the whole clever and thought-provoking. The acting is generally very good  both Leonardo DiCaprio  with a more hardened persona which has grown even more  and Ellen Page give strong performances and while Marion Cotillard is underused she is pretty good as well and Cillian Murphy I think gives the best supporting performance as he is superb.Overall  Inception is a generally good film but not as good as it is lauded to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox,positive

Did earth manage to conquer what the Krells could not?Christopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit heavy at times  it still is an unmistakable masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this and he's essentially a cat burglar of the mind. His mission usually is to invade people's dreams and steal ideas which makes him an invaluable espionage agent. But Leo's also a wanted man.Some problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on others to create dream worlds. He was working against Japanese billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught  but then Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the young heir to a communications conglomerate  Cillian Murphy. It's not to steal anything  but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream team. The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride. And its how Leo has to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on others.Very nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in that category. Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer Nolan's dialog with verve and conviction. I truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a frightening thought.,positive

His films may be sometimes flawed – as in the case of this one – and often overrated  but at least he's a guy working in Hollywood who strives for originality. INCEPTION might well be his most original film yet  a cerebral thriller that requires audiences to use their brains for once  rather than going over the same old ground. It's not quite the masterpiece that some say it is  but it is an engaging  well-made  and exciting movie that pretty much demands repeat viewings.The first two thirds of the movie had me spellbound. The set-up is intense  throwing out wonderful ideas at the audience and not hanging around to see whether they're accepted. It's definitely a film where you have to pay attention to every second  although saying that I had no trouble following what was going on. As our characters enter dream state after dream state  I was drawn into this world with them. Nolan is at the top of his game and even his super-fast-edited action sequences don't disappoint  with riveting gun battles and a fine car chase thrown in  too. Star Leonardo DiCaprio's back story adds an emotional core to the movie that it would have otherwise been missing and I loved being caught up in the various outlandish shenanigans.Which is why the ending is a little bit disappointing – not a lot  but a little bit nonetheless. The whole setup with the snowbound fortress smacks of Bond  and has a seen-it-all before quality the film sidestepped for the most part. It's as if Nolan pushed himself to the edge with the concepts he introduced in his movie  and then stepped back  afraid. We needed more scenes like the bit with the train and the revolving corridor  and less conventional action. There's plenty of scope for truly mind-blowing stuff in the dream worlds he so painstakingly creates – like the awesome early scene with the folding city. But then he just delivers some sub-Bond antics and wastes what could have been a truly superb premise.I also had a slight problem with the ending  which goes on and on  with multiple scenes dragged out in a manner reminiscent of RETURN OF THE KING (although never quite as bad as that). Still  these are minor flaws in an otherwise very well made and entertaining movie. The ensemble cast are great: DiCaprio has matured nicely as a thinking man's hero  and the normally irritating Ellen Page is okay as the character whom the viewer follows into the antics. Michael Caine delivers a nice cameo  and Ken Watanabe reminds us all of what a fine actor he is. There are also good turns for up-and-coming stars like Joseph Gordon-Levitt  Tom Hardy  and Marion Cotillard  and a very nice performance from one of my favourites  Cillian Murphy. So  while it may not be the masterpiece that I was hoping for  INCEPTION is definitely a step in the right direction of intelligent Hollywood filmmaking.,positive

Sure  our eyes and ears are treated to amazing sites and loud noises each and every week and some would say this causes the brain just to lose any type of reality  which might be the reason certain people (cough Lohan  Hilton and countless others) are able to be hot stories while better  more worthwhile events are simply overlooked. If one doesn't want to use their brain then it's best to stay away from this thing. It's best not to know too much about the story but it deals with a troubled man (Leonardo DiCaprio) who has made it a job to break into people's dreams and steal their ideas. However  due to a personal tragedy  he is forced to take a job doing the opposite  which is breaking into a man's dream to plant an idea. That's pretty much all you need to know  storywise  as director/writer Nolan will deliver the rest and while the end result wasn't a pure masterpiece to me  there's no way you can deny the power it does contain. Dreams have always played an interesting part in movies but no other has taken you this far into them and delivered such incredible ideas. Not only does the screenplay deliver a lot to think about but we also get plenty of action and amazing scenes of destruction. The trailer showed people just a little pinch of a city turning upside down but seeing the full sequence was something truly amazing. Other amazing sequences was the entire final hour when our group of dream breakers must enter a multiple layer of dreams with one damaging effect after another. If you're familiar with Nolan then you already know what he can do and there's no question the man has talent but it is something special that a film like this could be pulled off at all. When you're dealing with multiple characters in multiple spaces and in multiple dream zones it would be easy and common for things to just fall apart under their own weight. It's very difficult to keep you guessing from one moment to another without things either falling apart or getting so complicated that the viewer simply gives up on the film and moves on. The amazing thing is that Nolan never lets up on the gas and instead just delivers one more bit of story on top of the next and I thought it was amazing that he could keep the viewing coming along for the ride and never lose us. I think some people are going to not understand what's going on or be able to figure out the multiple levels but when you kick back and think about what you've seen I think most will see that the maze had an entrance and an exit and nothing came as a cheat. DiCaprio delivers yet another wonderful performance but he's got a terrific cast around him including Ellen Page  Michael Caine  Joseph Gordon-Levitt  Marion Cotillard  Cilliam Murphy  Pete Postlethwaite and a great return from Tom Berenger. Each actor does fine work in their roles and certainly help the story move along. The nature of the story is a very good one but the visual effects are just as good. Looking at all the action and amazing effects makes one really appreciate the acting  directing and story even more simply because they didn't get lost behind everything else that was going on. I don't think there's any question that one needs more than a single viewing to catch everything happening here but that's certainly not a bad thing since each viewing will deliver bits and pieces that will probably take the film into directions that you didn't think were there.",positive

Some are even able to use your dreams to influence your actions. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is skilled at stealing secrets by diving into your dreams. It's a dark treacherous world where he has made too many enemies. Now he is offered a chance to come in from the cold. This time his team is tasked to plant an idea into the target's mind  or in one word inception.Christopher Nolan has created something of a Penrose-stairs structure in this movie. It's complicated and may be too convoluted to be reasonable. But that's as much part of its charm. The worlds  the effects  the ideas are all first rate. It is oozing with originality.The actors are also first rate. Nolan can command the best cast to his projects now. There is nobody better than DiCaprio to anchor this movie. Nothing about this movie is done with lesser parts. This is indeed a top movie.,positive

That's what true art is. That's why a black light Elvis is not art. This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art  it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all  the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened  only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing  it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels. Great movie.,positive

But first things first: The writer and direcctor here is of course Christopher Nolan and his British/American production from 2010 is maybe still his defining effort ten years later. They are showing this in theaters now again for said tenth anniversary and I happily took the chance to give it another watch  my third in fact and it definitely was not worse than my first or second. This is the kind of film that is indeed a lot better to be seen on the big screen  not only  but also because of the special effects. This movie won four Oscars  so also a big success with awards bodies  especially because it took home 150 more awards and over 200 more nominations and that is just what is listed here on imdb. Still I remember many people outraged back then because the one thing it did not get was an Oscar nomination for Nolan himself as director despite getting in at pretty much every important precursor. However  now in 2020  he also has his director nod and for this film here he got the writing nomination at least and that is absolutely alright because I think that the writing is the film's best aspect probably. Utter genius involved here and even more impressive if it was Nolan all on his own apparently.No Oscar nominations for the cast here. I think the only one who was slightly considered was Marion Cotillard and I would have liked it. She was really good  but then again I am a fan of her anyway. But it wasn't meant to happen and that is perfectly fine. She has one trophy already anyway  also did back then  which maybe helped her also in terms of getting cast here. She is one of several cast members that have worked with Nolan on other occasions before or after this movie  even if I think her portrayal in the final Batman film did not receive such positive acclaim overall. Oh well  others would be Murphy  Hardy and of course Michael Caine  who only has very little screen time here  two scenes and his second scene only lasts for a few seconds  but the first is really nice when his character meets the protagonist. Then there's a few actors whose star has gone down a bit in the last 10 years since this movie was made. Murphy may fit the description too to some extent  but I mostly mean the younger folks like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page. And Pete Postlethwaite is already dead for a few years  a bit sad knowing that now with how we see his character here dying too. May he rest in peace. But speaking of JGL  his role here is a bit of an example why he would never make it big in Hollywood. His character so plays second fiddle to Leonardo DiCaprio that it was a bit embarrassing almost here and there and among the weaker components of the film. Take the very early part already how he is trying so hard to convince Watanabe's character  while Leo knows his value and is all smooth and cool. Or how JGL is the one being caught and used to put pressure on Cobb (Leo) and even gets a bullet in the head. Or how he falls from the chair  kicked by Hardy I think  to elaborate on another phenomenon how people wake up from dreams. Oh yes  Watanabe I mentioned. Him I liked and like in general as an actor. I wish his character could have had more screen time to be honest  but his injury got in the way  but as we were sliding down the spheres  he gets better again. Still a bit strange how he so effortlessly turns into good guy and part of the team while being the antagonist before that and also with no real knowledge on the subject accompanies the thieves in their crucial endeavor involving Murphy's character. He was not really needed though.Another character who becomes part of the gang is Ellen Page's. She had some good moments and some not so good moments. Definitely not on par with the one other significant female character here  namely Cotillard's  but overall she is alright. The conscience scene with the ""people"" looking at her with angry faces is among the most memorable of the entire film. How she pushes these huge mirrors in position to show us the concept of going deeper and deeper into the mind  layer by layer  was also really good. But the idea that she really joins the gang too is already difficult to believe  but her return and talk about utter creation make me almost forget about it. What I cannot forget  however  is her final idea to step down to the bottom layer where Watanabe's character is lost. They acted as if this layer was simply too tough to take and then minutes later they are like okay well no biggie  let's go there and fix everything. The real final antagonist  namely Hal (Cotillard)  waiting there alone sure cannot justify their initial thoughts about that layer and its impact. As for Cotillard's character  of course the French music was a pretty telling inclusion again linked to her previous Oscar-winning movie for sure. Everybody who saw that one  must have made the connection. Anyway  speaking of Page's character again  kinda telling that she gets an implied romantic relationship with the kiss moment between her character and JGL's. That was one of the very few funny moments and that is fine. It was okay  but no need to stretch it or turn it into a romance movie. Nolan has many other  bigger strengths and I am glad he focused on these.Also in my showing  some people laughed at everything they got the chance to laugh at. It was pretty embarrassing. They knew nothing about movie quality. Anyway  Nolan's biggest strength here is the attention to detail. As good as the overall concept may be  the best thing is what he did with these small moments  such as the carpet having the wrong material and we realize it is just a dream within a dream. There are many other examples  such as everything involving Hardy's character too. He also brought in some comedy  like when he is that lady or when he guns down the enemy and tells JGL's character to think big. But the overall concept is just as good  the idea of how being killed in a dream makes you wake up  all the layers  or the idea how we do not remember the beginning of a dream (how did the two get there?) and a lot more. Nolan's script really oozes brilliance and creativity here and I would have been totally fine with it winning a fifth Oscar. Or even with the film winning Best Picture  which it admittedly never had a shot at. But the concept of dreaming and how little we and science know about it now in the 21st century is something that has fascinated me for a long time really  especially because I am a very heavy and intense dreamer myself. So exactly my cup of tea this movie and maybe people with little interest in the overall idea will like it less. Or maybe not  if we take a look at the really high rating here on imdb and this really high ranking up in the top250. Not undeserving. Nolan created a world of genius.At the same time  away from all the sci-fi  he also managed to create a touching story between Cobb and Hal. The scene when she jumps down from the roof is of course especially haunting  but also how we never see their children's faces in the dream because Cobb refuses to until he sees them in reality. And does so in the end. Happy end? Maybe. But to me it all felt so rushed with how he meets the old self of Watanabe's character (by the way the quote about how he simply bought the airline was another great comedic moment  maybe Nolan is not as bad as I thought and should finally make a 100% comedy movie)  turns him into a young man again within seconds and they all wake up inside the plane and even Murphy's character makes his peace again with his old man. And finally Cobb can  thanks to the Asian's help  get back to America and see his kids and then we see the swirling totem. Hal's totem. Does that mean we are indeed in her dream still. It could be with Nolan poking fun at unrealistic (in the truest sense of the word) rushed endings and nothing we saw was reality. Was Hal right all along? That's the good thing here. There is no 100% right or wrong. No 100% true or false and even if you watch this film ten times  you will still find something new you have not come across before  something new that can help you develop new creative approaches to the film and the reality depicted therein. Also have you ever asked yourself if you are in a dream yourself because when you are dreaming  then you usually don't know  so who says it couldn't be one we are all in right now. Anyway  this should be almost enough now with the review. You hopefully understood how much I liked this film.Just a few more snippets of information: 2010 was an amazing year for DiCaprio because he also appeared in Scorsese's ""Shutter Island""  another brilliant movie about the distorted human mind. I just mentioned the idea of totems. That I like as well  also with the additional idea that you should not let anybody touch your totem and how Cobb puts Page's character to a bit of a test there. Oh yes  another really smart reference the 1:10 proportion. One hour of dreaming equals ten hours of action in our dreams  which is why reality got slower and slower the further they dove down and how they showed it to us with the car crashing down the cliff (another happy ending that they are all saved) in fragments of 10% of a second maybe with all that has been going on underneath in the meantime was another stroke of genius for sure. There is so much to like here  it is pretty unreal. I am generally not a huge action film fan  but the very action-packed sequence in the icy region was good too. What can I say? I just like snow. Even if they had preferred an island in the sun or so. Another comedic moment. Alright. I think I'll leave it at that  even if there are another dozen moments at least so full of wit and creativity (just like myself) that they deserve elaboration on  but I won't because you need to watch it yourself instead!",positive

I do not understand the hype surrounding this film  probably the fruit of the market campaign of smart producers that lure naive viewers that seem that does not think and understand how flawed and stupid this story is. The plot is developed in fast pace to force the viewer to not think  with incoherent rules that do no make sense and that change in each layer of the dream in accordance with the intention of the writer. The best part of this film is the hilarious IMDb User Rating that reflects how brainless the Hollywood cinema has become in the contemporary days.

It seems that any mainstream film (especially at summertime) that manages to at least do something different or clever will be hailed as a masterpiece simply because it is not Transformers 2. So watching it expecting to be amazed is probably the wrong state of mind to be in. Likewise it is probably not great to be expecting something impossible to follow  because again the film is very clearly constructed and even when action is occurring across several ""levels"" at once  I still found it easy to follow.The film is a thriller and  like many great thrillers it is one that is built on an imaginative and clever concept. The world of dream infiltration is well constructed and is also well delivered to the audience; some people near me were muttering and asking confused questions throughout  but personally I found it easy to follow for the most part – and not because I'm smart but because the film does a good job of bringing the viewer into the ideas and concept. In terms of being an action movie  the second half of the film does pick this up well and the race against time across all of the dream levels  with the editing bringing it all together well so that you don't lose what is happening and indeed the movement of time and the importance of the relative events are clearly understood to produce tension. Although the dream worlds are a bit too ""ordinary"" at times (most of our dreams are filled with things that don't make any sense or have echoes of things  rather than detailed cityscapes and gun battles) there is creativity in the visual design and in particular a Matrix-esquire battle in a spinning corridor is thrilling to watch.To its credit the stepping up of the action aspect does not mean that the ideas that got us here are abandoned because they are not. The importance of Cobb's subconscious and in particular his own gnawing guilt over the death of his wife initially appears to be just a way of having a repeatable ""baddie"" turning up in various places throughout the film  but actually she is well used to introduce doubt and alternative interpretations to the film. As everywhere else  the ending of the film was met with groans that there would not a confirmation of the ending. Personally I think that ""was the real level actually a dream"" is just an idea planted by the director to keep the audience from simply finishing the film and walking away from it and that the presented reality was actual reality. I can understand why some have disliked this because it could appear like Nolan is going ""or was it?"" without providing much more than the question  but I choose to see this as just another tease  which he is perfectly allowed to do since the whole film is about trying to get others to doubt their reality and change their own minds by themselves (although not really).The cast deliver well. DiCaprio manages to produce an engaging character who emotionally makes sense and it is his performance that helps the deeper material in his subconscious work well and be more accessible to the viewer. Gordon-Levitt is memorable for his action scenes but he is also a good presence generally even if he has a lot less to do. Page provides the viewer with someone to ""come in"" with and she works that angle well. Hardy  Watanabe and Rao round out the team well. Some of the bigger names had the potential to be distractions by virtue of ""oh look its x"" but Caine  Berenger  Haas and Postlethwaite didn't really do that even if their actual screen times were minimal compared to the recognisability of their faces. Cotillard works very well to have her character vary across levels and contexts and I liked her better than I thought I would.I'm not in agreement that Inception is a classic perfect film but it is a very good one. If anything the elevation of this film is more to do with how average and uninspiring the vast majority of films released are  but I suppose that the success of this one is a good thing in some ways to maybe counter that. The concept and ideas are well constructed and presented to the audience and the film itself is not hard to follow but does challenge the viewer to do the one thing that a blockbuster normally doesn't – pay attention. Doesn't quite live up to the hype but it is still a very good and engaging film.",positive

Dicaprio is man who is an expert at entering dreams and extracting information for corporate espionage. He has a problem in that there is a price on his head. He is a wanted man. A Japanese business man wants Dicaprio to enter the mind of a competitor and place an idea in his head to break up his empire. In exchange Dicaprio (Dom Cobb) would be allowed to go home to his family. Cobb first gets an architect (Ellen Page) who can design a complex location  such as a dungeon master creating the stage. He then must assemble a team of people with different skills to navigate through the dream world.The beginning of the movie is a bit confusing as you don't know what is real and what is a dream. However this shortly clears up. Dom Cobb has a lot of issues concerning his past life and dreamworld which jeopardizes the mission. His dead wife keeps showing up to foil his plans and he just hasn't the heart to kill her. The dreamworld works like a narcotic. Once you go into it  reality becomes boring. This movie is more brilliant in its complexity and script than it is in entertainment  but it worked for me.,positive

Don't expect me to answer that. Don't expect the movie to be everything. It can not be. And don't assume  just because you liked/hated the movie  everyone else should feel the same way. Nor just assume that you can pinpoint every viewer or put everybody in 3 categories. People are far too complex to analyze and put into one category.What I mean by that  is that you can like this and Transformers. Or hate both. You can also over-analyze this movie and list it's flaws (yes it has them as every movie has them and depending on your view of it  you might spot them and care or not)  but apart from being visually stunning  it has a breathtaking story. And an ending that has been spoofed (at various internet sites)  but that works very fine for the movie. Of course you could also feel that the end is a cheat. But again  I cannot tell you how to feel about this movie (or any other movie for that matter)  I can only tell you  that it looks amazing and it made me chuckle for quite a few minutes in a breath-taking sequence.And no I did not get everything when I first watched it. I watched it a second time and there are still questions unanswered. Does or would something like that bother you? I didn't bother and the movie fully matched the expectations I had (this was my number 1 expected movie for 2010  the second most expected being ""Wall Street 2"").

That's because the picture moves across various levels and back again over the course of the story  and though it may seem confusing  you'll be OK if you keep in mind the premises offered by the inception team - DiCaprio  Levitt  Hardy  Page and Rao. I'm purposely leaving off Watanabe because he was by his own admission a 'tourist' and had a stake in the outcome.In a movie universe that's virtually impossible to crack with something original  this is the most creative picture I've seen in a long time. Like an intriguing time-travel story  this one grabs hold of the imagination and allows one to consider the possibilities of an alternate reality. The closer technology brings us to these cutting edge barriers of time  space and mind  the more fantastic becomes the possibility of turning virtual reality into the real thing.The movie's strongest feature is it's exposition. The characters both show and tell the viewer what to expect  quite unusual when it comes to the 'tell' part  because we usually rely on the development of the characters and the events they experience to bring us along for the ride. The concepts here are much more esoteric  especially when attempting to layer the events of the story in a 'dream within a dream' construct. For the most part  I think this was all done quite cleverly  but again  you have to pay attention.It would be tough to come up with the most interesting concept touched on by director Nolan  but the one that intrigued me the most was the idea of the dreamer having the ability to block an extraction. In Fischer's (Cillian Murphy) case  his training foresaw the need to 'militarize' his subconscious against attack  thereby creating 'projections' that in turn attacked the inception team. Another clever idea involved the zero gravity effects of participants in the Level Two dream during the Fischer inception. This is all done with such frenetic skill that it's sometimes tough to keep up with  although repeat viewings clear up what may have been missed the first time around. Another hint - use the captions on your DVD to capture all the dialog. The players tell you a lot of what you need to know to follow the story.I don't want to go too far out on a limb and tell you this is the greatest thing since sliced bread  because I know the film won't appeal to everyone. However enthusiasts of good science fiction will find a lot to like here  as it invites the viewer to expand one's consciousness and dream of the possibilities. Seriously folks  no one had to plant the idea  it just came out like that.,negative

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb  who has the technology to enter people's dreams to obtain secret information. The climax comes when Cobb and his cohorts enter the dream of an executive  going deeper and deeper into his subconscious.Despite the high action  ""Inception"" is not really an action movie  but more of a psychological thriller. The movie has a slightly nonlinear plot  similar to ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige"". This helps to stress the dreamlike state that the movie depicts. If in fact the movie has any problem  it's that it's sometimes hard to tell when the characters are dreaming and when it's real life. But on the other hand  this also shows how smoothly Nolan lets the story flow. Watching the movie  I came to realize things about my own dreams that I had never previously thought about. The apparent descent into insanity and links to Cobb's past bring to mind ""Insomnia"".Much like how Nolan put a new spin on the Batman franchise  ""Inception"" takes psychological thrillers to the next step. It even goes beyond ""The Matrix"". All in all  I certainly recommend it.Also starring Ken Watanabe  Joseph Gordon-Levitt  Marion Cotillard  Ellen Page  Tom Hardy  Cillian Murphy  Dileep Rao  Tom Berenger and Michael Caine (who has so far starred in every one of Nolan's movies since ""Batman Begins"").",positive

That is unheard of. Not to say it is not a great film  but I am a little shocked by this. I give it an 8...Long story short  Christopher Nolan is a genius. He has a ton of films on the top 250 list  and still has along career ahead of him. This film was both written and directed by him  and the story and visuals are striking. Some of the story I think is a bit iffy (if you are too critical it might have major holes) but if you are accepting its basic premise  it is a solid concept that has not been explored before.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb  and Leo is always a good lead. The family issues here tread close to where ""Shutter Island"" tread  but this only shows where that other film fell short (as much as I enjoyed both).Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur  and was for me the most pleasant surprise of the film. I still have a hard time accepting him as a legitimate actor and not just a cheesy  comedic character. But here I was moved. He did his own stunts during what was by far my favorite scene of the film  and although he still looks twenty (he was 29 at the time this film came out) he has lots of potential.Ellen Page was a decent Ariadne (her most adult role yet)  and it was nice to see Nolan veterans Cillian Murphy and Michael Caine back for more. And a special shout-out to Pete Postlethwaite (Maurice Fischer) in what was one of his very final roles.Anyway  a must-see if ever there was one in the last few years. 9 out of 10? Maybe. 6th greatest film ever? I don't know... but definitely one of those rare gems of the last decade.",positive

Basically  Dominic 'Dom' Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a skilled thief who steals valuable secrets in dangerous extraction  he enters a person's subconscious in their dreams  when the mind is most vulnerable. He is troubled man however  haunted by the memory's of his past with wife Mallorie 'Mal' (Marion Cotillard) and their subconscious experiences  and he is dying to change his past via the dream state. Saito (Batman Begins' Ken Watanabe) is offering him the chance of redemption by carrying out one last job using the subconscious entry  an impossible mission called inception. This would involve entering the mind of Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy)  who has gained control of the company his recently deceased father Maurice (Pete Postlethwaite) owned  and placing in his mind the idea to shut down this company. So Cobb assembles a crack team of experts in the field of dream extraction and knowledge of inception  including Arthur ((500) Days of Summer's Joseph Gordon-Levitt)  Ariadne (Juno's Ellen Page)  Eames (Tom Hardy) and Yusuf (Dileep Rao). To make sure the mission can succeed they plan to go into a dream lasting ten hours  the length of Fischer's regular plane journey  and they will be going through three layers of dream state  i.e. Dream within a dream within a dream. So the main dream is Fischer and his assistant Peter Browning (Platoon's Tom Berenger) caught as hostages  and Fischer is convinced Browning is keeping something about his father from him. Then the next dream is Fischer convinced by Cobb that someone is trying to get into his head for this big secret  and he agrees to go into a dream to find out what the big secret is. Of course the dream states collide with each other  so the main dream sees some car chases as distractions in the big maze  so gravity for example of the characters in sleep will come into play in the other dreams too. But also the big problem with Cobb being in the dream is that his thoughts are being projected into the dream as well  such as the appearance of his wife and kids  his wife even kills Fischer when they need him most  forcing Cobb to go into his own memory of dream. In the end  the big secret placed into Fischer's mind is that his father wanted him to go his own way and create another company  and Cobb manages to come out with Saito as themselves  and the past is changed for Cobb for the better. Also starring Sir Michael Caine as Miles and Witness's Lukas Haas as Nash. There is a thought hanging over you when you watch that you really have to concentrate  but at the same time it is quite easy to keep up with where you are. If you can keep up with it  like I did manage to  you are completely taken in by the great action sequences  the well chosen cast  the imaginative concept  and the brilliant special effects to make it all possible  a fantastic and cool science-fiction action thriller. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography  Best Sound Editing  Best Sound Mixing  and Best Visual Effects  and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year  Best Art Direction  Best Music  Original Score for Hans Zimmer  and Best Writing  Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen  it won the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects  Best Production Design  and Best Sound  and it was nominated for Best Film  the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music  Best Cinematography  Best Editing  and Best Original Screenplay  and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama  Best Original Score  and Best Screenplay.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb  a man who goes into other people's dreams to steal their secrets. One day a man approaches him with a far more difficult proposition; he wants an idea planted in the mind of a business rival; an idea the man must think was his own. Cobb is initially less than keen to do the job but the man has promise that he can arrange for him to get home to his children; something he can't currently do because he is suspected of killing his wife. To do the job he must assemble a team and take his target into a dream designed my new recruit Ariadne. This is no ordinary dream though; it requires the team to enter a dream within a dream within a dream! It is complicated further by the facts that his dead wife haunts Cobb and that if any of them die in the dream they will be trapped in a limbo.Director Christopher Nolan ably demonstrates that a big blockbuster film doesn't need to be in 3D these days nor does it need to be devoid of complicated ideas to succeed. DiCaprio did a fine job as Cobb and it was nice to see the excellent Ellen Page playing somebody who wasn't still a schoolgirl! While this film was about ideas that doesn't mean it wasn't full of spectacular special effects; while many of them were clearly computer generated they looked real enough to enable the viewer to suspend their disbelief in a way that often isn't possible. The idea of dreams within dreams could have been very confusing but each dream was very different so the viewer doesn't forget which layer of the dream is which once the action begins. If you have being putting off watching this film because you have been put off by the hype don't worry and watch it now; it is great.,positive

Today  am I a butterfly dreaming I am a man?"" Marcus Aurelius  the late Roman emperor and philosopher  wrote  ""Life is a dream  a little more coherent than most."" Freud concluded that dreams were the fulfillment of unconscious wishes that had managed to sneak past the dozing censor. Aboriginal Australians believed in a real parallel universe called The Dream Time in which everything and everyone who ever existed  still existed  and anybody could enter this place during sleep.Modern psychology believes that dreams are nothing more than random cortical bombardment caused by a lot of activity in sub-cortical structures associated with the filing of memories  and the cortex goes into overdrive trying to make narrative sense of them. Sex dreams are pleasant enough except when the furry little animals show up  but statistics demonstrate that the majority of dreams are truly lousy  the kind we can easily live without. Don't you get tired of running in slow motion through a swamp while being chased by an ogre? Does all this sound like pointless rambling to you? Well  then you're not going to enjoy ""Inception"" because it meanders at lightning speed all over the place and lives by no rules that human beings have ever known.On the other hand  if you find these adventitious allusions in some way interesting  then you should see this dark and muddled movie. You get a bonus too  because in its style it closely resembles an action movie from the 1980s. Everything is happening all at once -- or maybe not all at once. Who cares? The point is that people get shot in the forehead and buildings comes toppling down for no reason and slow-motion explosions take place at irregular but short intervals.I'm getting pretty tired of seeing films that use some bewildering metaphysical scheme as an excuse to show off still more CGIs.

And now I know what all the fuzz was about.""Inception"" is simply put a groundbreaking movie for our times  just like ""Matrix"" was back in 1999.The story told in ""Inception"" is very captivating and you get really caught up in the events as they unfold. The story is the type that grips you tight and takes you on one amazing thrill ride. I will not go into depth about the actual storyline  but the notion about going into another person's subconscious and dreams is quite interesting. And going in there to plant the seed of a new idea is even more interesting. Enough said.As for the cast in ""Inception""  well that was simply phenomenal. Lots of really good performances done here  but of course  we are dealing with good actors and established names here. Of course Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role as Cobb. I haven't been much fond of his previous work  but since ""Shutter Island""  he has really started to become noticeable (for me at least). And his performance in ""Inception"" was right on the money  very nice indeed. Of course  he wasn't the sole carrier of the movie  he was well helped along by Joseph Gordon-Levitt  playing Arthur  and he was really standing out on the screen. He did such a super job with his character  and I think he was the one actually carrying the heavy load of the movie. Then there was Ellen Page  playing Ariadne  which was quite an interesting role to see her in. Actually  the list goes on and on with really good actors here  such as Ken Watanabe  Michael Caine  Cillian Murphy  and so on.What appealed to me about the movie was the concept of the entire story. Of being able to go into a person's mind and influence his dreams and thoughts. However unlikely it may be  it still came off quite nice on the screen.A movie like this is nothing without special effects. And ""Inception"" sure had a bunch of really nice effects along the way. There were some really mind-boggling CGI effects going on at places. And the effects also had a huge part to do with the final outcome of the movie.Despite it being a rather long movie  the time does fly by as you watch it  because you are so caught up in the story. And that was really great  film-making when it is best; entertainment that makes you forget all about time and space.

Dream on.,04-Apr-11,At what point does a film become too complicated for its own good? In the case of Inception  almost immediately: in a bid to make the ultimate 'mind-f**k' movie  writer/director Christopher Nolan starts his film at 'bloody confusing' and  over the course of 148 excruciatingly drawn-out minutes  works his way up to 'completely and utterly unfathomable' before leaving the film on a predictably ambiguous note (thus allowing endless discussion on movie forums).Along the way  Nolan introduces many an intriguing idea  but the ones that haven't been nicked from far better movies (eXistenZ  Vanilla Sky  The Matrix  Dark City  Cypher) are so half-baked that the film inevitably becomes a frustrating mess of contradiction and contrivance which conjures up an endless stream of questions (see IMDb's FAQs)  none of which seem to have any satisfying answers (despite the best efforts of Nolan's rabid fan-boys).Lost in Inception's labyrinthine plot  all I could do was sit back and marvel at the special effects—which are undeniably impressive—whilst asking myself repeatedly how Ariadne (Ellen Page) became such a great architect despite no actual work experience  and whether such a pretty young woman would really be happy to be sedated in a grubby warehouse by a group of suspicious looking strangers. Somehow  I doubt it.5 out of 10 for its jaw-dropping effects (in particular  the awesome gravity-defying fight scene)  and I reckon that's being generous.,positive

These days  if a film is complexly-layered it is automatically deemed art...not popcorn entertainment ready for mass consumption  but high art. If ""small minds"" are unable to grasp the film's deeper meanings  those poor folks are disregarded as unworthy participants in the ultimate game. ""Inception"" is a game--and  at times  a grand one--but it isn't a masterpiece. It's a gun-crazy  gadget-mad  hyperactive Rubik's Cube of a movie. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the grieving Cobb  a dream extractor who enters into the sleeping minds of others to gather vital information which cannot be obtained any other way. Unfortunately  memories of his late wife (and guilt over her mysterious death) are so vivid they are permeating Cobb's subconscious; and inevitably those haunted images follow him helplessly on his jaunts into the dream-state. The movie has very little exposition  with a confusing prologue later revealed to be the starter threads to the epilogue  and doesn't really get going until we are introduced to Cobb's latest case involving a dying billionaire  his crestfallen son  and the final draft of the tycoon's will which is locked up in a safe no one knows the combination to. The other participants in the project are a brainy  adept  and engaging group of people we become quite fond of; often times  particularly in a perplexing movie such as this one  having such smart  savvy characters populating the scenario makes the ride that much more enjoyable (not forgetting of course that humans are never so vulnerable to danger as when they are asleep). What doesn't really work are the constant sniper attacks in the dreams--projections which manifest themselves as an angry militia--as well as a visual impersonation of the son's godfather  which is necessary to the plot but becomes little more than a complicated footnote. The level of dreams our heroes pass through  one more dangerous than the last  provide the picture with a visual kick  and the nonchalant manner in which the characters respond to their strange new surroundings accent ""Inception"" with a giddiness not usually found in big-budget action films. I'm not sure whether or not Christopher Nolan violates his own movie-rules in order to cap the film with an emotional bow  but he does get solid performances from his cast  a rich and delectable production design from his art department  and swirling  hallucinogenic special effects from his creative team. Is the movie a mind-blowing experience? For many audiences  it certainly will be. As with all 'summer epics' and popcorn crowd-pleasers  this one's crazy glow will probably fade in the stretch (I can't imagine the film will hold up so well once it goes the home-video route--it's a theatrical experience  after all). It is not a work of art  however that doesn't mean it isn't sheer pleasure from start to finish. *** from ****",positive

Many like to see a movie once  maybe take a few calls or texts during its running time  and never feel like they miss anything. And  when it is over  they are happy with the experience. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that type of movie-watching.However  that type will not do well with ""Inception."" This movie is more for those of us who like to watch every bit of every scene  hear every word of dialog  and try to piece together a fairly complex story. Some can watch 'Inception' through just once and get everything  and I applaud them for that. But I needed to see it maybe four times  over an almost two year period  to appreciate fully how good it is. Leonardo DiCaprio is in the lead role as Cobb  he has become an expert in ""extraction""  the surely illegal activity of going into dreams with others and in the process extract some secret or other information. A good use for such a talent is industrial and business espionage.But Cobb has a new client that approaches him for the opposite task  the insertion of an idea into the target's mind  and in this case make the subject think it was his own idea. That is the process they call ""Inception."" The idea for the story and resultant film was an approximate 10-year process for the writer/director Nolan. Much of the details are derived from his own dream experiences  such as what may seem like a day or week in a dream might be just a fraction of a minute in real time  and a familiar sound or loss of equilibrium might bring you out of your dream. The client that hires Cobb is Ken Watanabe as Saito. The subject is Cillian Murphy as Robert Fischer  whose industrialist father is about to die  and if the company is not forced to break into smaller units they will monopolize their market. The task is to  through inception  convince Robert that breaking the now his company into smaller units is his idea. To do that is a very complex task  and requires meticulous planning and several levels of dreams. All does not go as planned  unexpected assassins tail them  and all this provides for the drama and action.Another layer of intrigue is added by Cobb's situation  where his wife had died some time before but he was blamed  and as a result he has not been able to travel back to his home and children in the USA. He still sees her  in dreams  often when he doesn't really want to  while she tries to convince him they are not really in a dream  but real.Cobb's team members include Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur  Ellen Page as Ariadne  Tom Hardy as Eames  and Dileep Rao as the chemist for the sedative drugs  Yusuf.His wife is Marion Cotillard as Mal.I like this movie a lot  there is so much in it that I see many 'new' things each time. I look forward to seeing it again several times  maybe 6 to 12 months between viewings. I have it on Blu-ray and the video and audio are just state-of-the-art.

After Mulholland Drive  I spent hours on the Internet  and then I had to watch it again. A great film but man was I lost.I'm sure this sounds funny to many young IMBb members  who see this kind of film all the time  but this Casablanca fan gets confused easily. For that  I thank writer/director Christopher Nolan  whose scripts for ""The Prestige "" ""Memento "" and ""Batman Begins "" I absolutely loved. He's really a favorite.Another favorite of mine is the ever-boyish Leonardo DiCaprio  who is a wonderful actor and gives a great performance in his role  ably supported by the always excellent Marion Cotillard  Cillian Murphy (a new favorite)  and the rest of the cast.Someone somewhere who hated this movie said that anyone who thought Nolan was trying to say something serious is crazy. I don't know if he was or not  but I think the whole subject of the subconscious and the dream state and creating a reality are intriguing topics. Many do question is our whole reality on earth is a dream. Not sure ""Inception"" really answers that  but it's an absorbing film.",positive

It also is one of the highest rated films ever on IMDB. And  so much has been said about the film  I think I'll be rather brief.The plot involves a guy who learns that nothing be sees or does is real...and that the world is nothing like anyone thinks. This is because in the dystopian future  machines keep folks in pods and they live out their lives in a phony existence.The film's story is interesting...and very existential. I like that aspect of it very much. But the film has a weakness for me and I am sure some other folks might feel the same way...there is just too much action. The film is one scene after another after another--with lots of action  violence and CGI...so much that it boggles the mind. For me  that left me rather tired when the film was over. I liked it...but I also didn't want any more and can't see me watching any of the sequels.,negative

This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put  the film looks amazing in its audacious production design  dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist  super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.Use of sound was also striking  and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly  while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes  mysticism  philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.Action is superbly shot and edited  and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy  Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds  this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler  certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles)  an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.Summing up  not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels  both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox,positive

Well  let me tell you: it's a crowd-pleasing science fiction adventure  which took audiences by surprise as it came out of nowhere and totally destroyed the year's other big sci-fi epic  THE PHANTOM MENACE. The reason for its success is quite obvious when you look at it. The film isn't just about special effects  although they do play a big part; it also has a rather complex and classic sci-fi set up. While STAR WARS was all bad special effects and little else  THE MATRIX is all good special effects and a lot more besides.Okay  so there are some obvious flaws: a lack of originality for one; the real futuristic world looks like something out of BLADE RUNNER and there are bits out of DARK CITY thrown in too. The story  too  once it has been set up  is dropped in favour of some increasingly outlandish action sequences. But when these action scenes are fantastic  then you just don't care. After all  I watch a film to be entertained  and fighting and explosions are the simplest source of entertainment around.The actors and actresses in the film are all okay  although you have to wonder if Carrie-Anne Moss was picked simply because she looks good in PVC. No matter  as it's left to Keanu Reeves in his best role for some time  to carry the film. While he may not be much of an actor (the sheer awfulness of his performance in BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is hard to forget)  he just about manages to make his role as a mild-mannered computer operator who becomes a heroic saviour believable. Thankfully  there is some heavyweight support from Laurence Fishburne as the imposing leader of the rebels  and a wonderfully villainous performance from Hugo Weaving as the slimy villain. The costumes are great too - stylish leather and sunglasses making up the main attire.The film is not really about acting  though  or story. It's the special effects which make this  well  special. Without them  it would just be another average tale  but these CGI effects are truly outstanding  even on the small screen. For once  they do fit into the context of the story as well  as they are computer effects in a computer generated world. THE MATRIX has brilliant CGI  and has to join the ranks of TERMINATOR 2  JURASSIC PARK  and INDEPENDENCE DAY as a film which really sets the ever-changing standard on which all other films are to be based.Bullets fly in slow-motion  leaving trails in the air; characters can spin in the air  climb walls and jump huge distances; computer-generated villains morph into other people at will  fights are impossibly fast. Indeed  it is the fight scenes which are the most memorable  as they come across as a hybrid of the classic kung fu genre and the very best of style master John Woo. The best moments are the Fishburne/Reeves training fight  the moment where Reeves takes on Agent Smith in a subway  and the lobby shootout where plaster literally flies everywhere. You also have to love the ending  where Reeves finally wins over the baddies and manages to stop bullets mid-flight with his bare hand. A great image  just one of loads in this great film which has to be one of my favourite sci-fi films of the decade.,positive

Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget  the production value is incredible. They have squeezed every movie magic out of all the visual and computer effects.,positive

I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago  but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah  not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom  we find out later  are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently  weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But  it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.",positive

Yes. Groundbreaking? Not really.,29-Nov-14,"15 years ago  back in the 20th century  the first of so far three Matrix films was released. It runs for roughly 2 hours and 15 minutes and was directed by the Wachowski brothers Andy and Lana (still Larry back then). The film stars Keanu Reeves with supporting performances by Carrie Anne Moss  Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving.I cannot say I didn't enjoy this film as I really liked it to some extent  but I was not wowed either  maybe because science fiction is not exactly my favorite genre. My biggest problem was possibly Reeves in the lead role. I just fail to see him as a guy who brings the necessary toughness for his character here and in any other action movie. All this praise about him being the chosen one made me cringe occasionally. The dialogs about him being so grand were sometimes downright cheesy and same goes for the explosions coming with the final kiss between Reeves' and Moss' characters. Another criticism I had was the Oracle being wrong. She was presented as a know-it-all authority and in the end her prediction is simply disregarded with the explanation  Neo has to find his way and then he is the chosen one if he chooses to be. Oh and the song during the closing credits did not match my taste at all.What I did like about the film were basically all the supporting players  especially Fishburne and Moss also. The helper-turned-villain was creepy in his big scene and Weaving was a revelation. His antagonist really makes the film and the film was at its best during the scenes he was in. The camera shot with Weaving before the subway train runs over him was certainly the best shot of the movie  maybe the whole trilogy. His parallel on humans being the real virus of the planet makes you wonder too if he is maybe right. Other than that  I liked the pill reference from ""Alice in Wonderland"" early on and the green code on black ground is certainly memorable and immediately associated with this film.Finally  I would like to say that I recommend this movie  especially to sci-fi lovers although they probably have seen it already anyway. It is not a film I really want to rewatch anytime soon  but it starts okay and gets better during the second half. I don't think the second and third Matrix films are much worse  but that is maybe because I don't consider the first a masterpiece. All three are solid. ""The Matrix"" won four technical Academy Awards  all four categories where it was nominated. It's no ""Return of the King""  but still an admirable achievement.",positive

The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park when it came to the visuals.Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.)Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.Keanu Reeves is in his element in a world where he does not understand what is around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Anne Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to think about the world around us and our place within it.The subtext of the film can be re-analysed in light of the personal journeys of the Wachowskis. Change and transformation. It is laughable to see the right wing attempting to co-opt the movie for their own agenda.The film is cool  it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit too po faced. However the Wachowskis did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the following two sequels.,negative

When he is approached by the shadowy terrorist Morpheus he chickens out and gets caught by the secret police.  However later Morpheus grabs him again and shows him the truth  that his life is a virtual reality provided by computers while his body  and the bodies of all other humans are harvested in pods for energy.  Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will bring down the matrix and return humans to the planet's surface  however the computers seek to kill the small group of humans who exist outside of the pods.  Neo learns to control the matrix to battle the computers.Has anyone not seen this?  The plot is a perfect set-up for all teenagers who believe their dull lives must be fake and that they can be a gun battling hero.  That's the story of Neo and it's well told  we have Neo in the matrix  Neo getting trained by Morpheus and then returning to battle the computer drones.  The story is involving and the effects make it totally convincing.  The plot is clever and never totally falls into action for action's sake.  Although the first half is far superior is better than the second which does tend to give into the rules of Hollywood excess.The action is fantastic.  After so many spoofs and rip-offs of the effects and martial arts (Charlie's Angels etc) it's easy to forget how amazing it was when it was first done here.  Here it is done well and isn't treated like a joke like it was in Charlie's Angels.  The plot being set in the matrix means we can accept the effects as part of a VR creation and take them seriously without thinking they are OTT.  The only thing is that the action is so attractive that it's almost sexy  but should we find two trench coating wearing people walking into a building and killing dozens attractive?That aside it's cool to see wire work put into Hollywood movies (and done well too).  Reeves is cool and is suited to the role.  Fishburne is even better  how does he keep those glasses on?  Carrie Anne Moss is good but falls into the role of love interest later on.  Pantoliano is good and Weaving is slimy as one of the computer sentinels.The plot is good and opens itself to a nice religious interpretation that isn't very well hidden.  Neo is `the one' who has come to save mankind  Trinity is a character etc etc.  How this sits with the violence is anyone's guess but it makes it quite a nice distraction.Overall this is very enjoyable and very well scripted.  The only down side is that the fantastically choreographed fights and gun battles really glamorise violence to a worrying degree.  However if you're watching an action movie then that's what you accept otherwise don't watch.  For me  I can't wait for the sequels.,positive

And the Matrix is what came out. A great sci-fi movie  that has many elements from other movies (and a theme we have also seen in horror movies)  put well together.While I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan  he does convince here (as he did in Speed). So while he is in action territory  there is always fun to be had with him. Carrie Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne have great supporting roles  although of course it is more stylish adventure than anything else. And while the movie leaves quite a few questions open you might have  it works for the movie  being only told a minimum amount of plot. The Keanu Reeves character acts as the viewer as he is thrown in an unknown world. Being baffled and stunned by the whole thing  this might be the reason his casting works so good ...Apart from that  the action is amazing (Yuen Woo-Ping  very well known for his Asian/martial arts choreography's)  the set pieces and the dystopia feel of the movie is pretty convincing ...Edit: the above review is from 21 July 2009 - before I went to watch the new (fourth) installment in this ... triolgy (?)  I revisited the Matrix - Matrix revisited - to use the Matrix title name game. I stand by what I have written above. The cultural impact the movie had is enormous and that is putting it mildly. Back then nobody knew the brothers would become sisters  but I don't think that should play a role on what I wrote or what you think about the movie.If you watch it under that aspect and also including the rumor that the Neo character was supposed to also be female at certain realities (or worlds) - also considering how Trinity is more centred and more masculine in a sense .. and how some feel that the connection between Neo and Trinity is more like a brother and sister energy ... well in hindsight there may have been some things we could ascribe to the siblings Wachowski ... quite a few to be honest. Which might bring us to the whole Luke and Leia thing ... but let's not get too psychological here.As written above  I do not feel that Keanu Reeves is the strongest ""actor"". That being said  he is more than a cool Dude. Although even in this and having seen it a few times now  he does play quite the intriguing fool. No pun and no offense intended. Even a character tells him that he sure isn't the brightest. Again that is about the character he portrays and is not meant to describe Keanu or his intellectual abilities.The Matrix changed the game ... it was also the driver for the then new format  called DVD. It would have been quite something if the new Matrix would have made the 4k discs popular ... but you can't capture lightning in a bottle twice. More on this on the new films page though. This has its flaws for sure (inner logic and all that)  but overall it is more than a winner. Bullet time  Hugo Weaving  Laurence Fishburn ... and the philosophical questions combined make for a great cocktail ... after they've been put in the blender with many other ingredients of course ... and the circle is completed once again.",positive

Watching today  it still holds up as an exciting sci-fi action thriller  with effects that still look relatively new even though many of them have been copied and even parodied since. I have to admit  time travel  dream stories and virtual reality films can leave you with your head hurting a bit  but if you watch this one attentively  you'll find that it was cleverly written leaving very little wiggle room for plot holes to creep through.Essentially  'The Matrix' is a computer generated dream world which replaced the 'real' world that was destroyed at some point during the twenty second century in a battle between humans and an artificial intelligence. The AI won  and subsequently created an entire race of machines feeding off the living energy of humans kept alive in a state of suspended animation. The very few humans still alive wait for the day that 'The One' will destroy the Matrix and free those under it's control. To protect itself  The Matrix has created a race of machines called Sentinels who track down humans  be it in the real world or in The Matrix itself. This can all get a little confusing  so it's best to take this all in with no distraction  because things move back and forth between the two realms rather quickly.If you really want to take the concept of the picture a step further  there's plenty here to dissect and analyze. For some  the religious and philosophical elements conveyed by The Matrix and The One are quite overt. One of the immediate thoughts that struck me was the parallel of The Matrix to The Force in ""Star Wars""  an eternal and universal life energy that unites all living creatures. The One can be interpreted as The Savior  the Redeemer of Mankind who will set all of humanity free from the curse of original sin  or in this case  the slavery of the pods. I guess if you're skeptical of this philosophic/religious connection  this will all be a lot of mumbo-jumbo  but to me it's a lot more interesting to look at it that way than just seeing a bunch of special effects involving insane martial arts moves and time stopping bullets in flight.What I didn't care for so much was the make up of the Sentinels  not the human ones but the machines. Personally  I thought Hugo Weaving was great as Agent Smith in his relentless pursuit of Neo. But the idea of those squid-like battle ships attacking the Nebuchadnezzar seemed to defy a certain logic. Wasn't Zion  the last human city located underground? The concept of The Oracle also catches one a bit off guard as well. I mean  my idea of an Oracle  who was supposed to know everything about The Resistance since the beginning  wasn't exactly that of an old woman who smokes cigarettes and bakes cookies. This introduction of a bit of whimsy might have been intriguing to the Wachowski Brothers  so if that's the case  I guess I can go along with it.Anyway  I like the idea of The Matrix and I like the movie. I can't say as much about the sequels  and it's been some time since I've seen those as well. I'll get around to them again eventually.",positive

Basically  in an abandoned hotel in a major city  Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is cornered by the police but overpowers them with superhuman abilities. He is chased whilst fleeing by the police and a group of black suited Agents  with similar superhuman abilities. She escapes by answering a ringing phone in a public telephone booth and vanishes. Computer programmer and hacker Thomas Anderson  known by his alias ""Neo"" (Keanu Reeves)  is confused by repeated online encounters with something called ""the Matrix""  and seeing the phrase ""Follow the White Rabbit"". He is approached by Trinity in a rave bar  she tells him he is in great danger  that they are watching him and that he is searching for answers  particularly to the most important question of all: what is the Matrix? The following morning  at Neo's job at Metacortex  a leading software company  a team of Agents and police  led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving)  arrive searching for him. Neo is contacted by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)  an infamous hacker  who attempts to guide him to safety  but he surrenders rather than risking his life trying to escape. The Agents attempt to coerce Neo into helping them locate Morpheus  who they claim is a terrorist. When Neo refuses  the agents fuse his mouth shut and implant a robotic ""bug"" in his stomach. Neo awakens believing that he had a nightmare. Soon after  Neo is taken by Trinity to meet Morpheus  and she removes the bug from Neo  proving what he experienced was real. Morpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills: the blue pill will return him to his former life  the red pill will reveal the truth about the Matrix. Neo chooses to take the red pill  his reality begins to distort  and he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others  containing other human beings. He is then brought aboard Morpheus' flying ship  the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod  Morpheus explains the situation: a war broke out between the human race and intelligent machines in the early 21st century  when the humans blocked the machines from accessing solar energy  the machines responded by capturing humans and harvesting their bioelectric power with their minds being trapped in the Matrix  a shared simulation of the real world that existed in 1999. The machines won the war  and the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to ""unplug"" enslaved humans and recruit them  and the Matrix's simulated nature allows them to bend its physical laws. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix would mean death to a real physical body  that the Agents are sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system  and  in the real world  machines called Sentinels are hunting the rebels. Morpheus virtually trains Neo with everything that is possible within the understanding of the Matrix  from kung fu fighting to firing weapons. Neo displays great ability and skill  cementing Morpheus' belief that he is ""The One""  a human prophesied to free humankind. The group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle (Gloria Foster)  the prophet who predicted that the One would emerge. She implies to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus' life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix  Agents and police have been tipped off by disgruntled crew member Cypher (Joe Pantoliano). He has tipped off the Agents to ambush the group in exchange to return to a comfortable life back in the Matrix. Morpheus buys time for the others by fighting with Agent Smith and is captured  while Mouse (Matt Doran) is shot to death. Cypher exits the Matrix and murders crew members Apoc (Julian Arahanga) and Switch (Belinda McClory)  while they are unconscious and connected. Before he can kill Neo and Trinity  crew member Tank (Marcus Chong) regains consciousness and kills Cypher before pulling Neo and Trinity from the Matrix. The Agents interrogate Morpheus to gain the access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion  which would allow them to destroy it. Neo is determined to return to the Matrix to rescue him  as the Oracle prophesied; Trinity insists she goes with him. While rescuing Morpheus  Neo gains confidence in his abilities  performing feats comparable to those of the Agents. As Morpheus and Trinity safely exit the Matrix  Smith ambushes and kills Neo. While a group of Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar  Trinity confesses her love for Neo and says the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One. Neo is revived with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix  he then leaps into Smith's body and causes him to explode  while the other Agents flee. He makes it out of the Matrix just as the ship's EMP (electromagnetic pulse) is activated and disables the attacking Sentinels inside the ship. Back in the Matrix  Neo makes a telephone call  promising the machines that he will show their prisoners ""a world where anything is possible"". He hangs up and flies away. Also starring Anthony Ray Parker as Dozer  Paul Goddard as Agent Brown  Robert Taylor as Agent Jones  David Aston as Rhineheart  Marc Aden Gray as Choi  Ada Nicodemou as Dujoir (White Rabbit Girl) and Deni Gordon as Priestess. Reeves gives a good performance as the recluse who may be saviour of humanity from cyberspace slavery  Fishburne is really likeable as the inspirational leader and teacher  Moss is terrific as the beautiful feisty love interest  Weaving enjoys himself being the snarling villain  and Pantoliano does well in his time onscreen. You can just about follow what's going on if you really concentrate (the colouring  green for the Matrix world and blue for the real world  it certainly helps you decipher)  with complex theories of philosophy and ancient mysticism  otherwise you can just enjoy it for its thrilling fight and chase sequences  fast and slow-motion  spectacular special effects  and amazing visuals  an impressive and unmissable science-fiction action. It won the Oscars for Best Editing  Best Sound Effects Editing  Best Visual Effects  and Best Sound  and it won the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects  and Best Sound  and it was nominated for Best Cinematography  Best Editing  and Best Production Design. It was number 66 on 100 Years  100 Thrills  and it was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",positive

I needn't have worried; I enjoyed it just as much as I did first time.The story begins with computer hacker Neo receiving strange message telling him somebody was about to knock on his door and that he should 'follow the white rabbit'; his door is knocked and his friends invite him to come out with him; he is about to refuse when he sees a white rabbit tattooed on one of their shoulders so goes with them. While out he meets another hacker  a woman called Trinity  who tells him that the legendary hacker Morpheus wants to meet with him. The next day at work he receives a call telling him the authorities want to take him into custody and he must follow precise instructions if he wishes to escape; he fails to do this and is arrested. During the interview with Agent Smith a strange bug is implanted and in a nightmarish manner his mouth becomes fused closed! The next thing he knows he is waking up in his apartment assuming it was just a strange nightmare but it soon becomes apparent that is was real. Taken to Morpheus by Trinity he learns that the world is not as it seems; he isn't in 1999 but 2199 and none of his life so far has been real; his body is plugged into a giant machine and he is experiencing something called The Matrix.Once woken he finds himself in a dead mechanical world with Morpheus  Trinity and a few other free people; they mention the last human city; Zion  but we never see it. Now he is free he must prepare to return to The Matrix which means learning the skills he will need to survive and gaining an understanding of what The Matrix really is. Once inside they will have to avoid Agents  parts of the program that will hunt them down as well as assuring that they stay hidden in the real world; if they die in either place their life is over.This is a must see for all science fiction and action fans; it has a fine story and spectacular action sequences; many of them reminiscent of those in Chinese Wuxia films with characters running up walls and doing impossible leaps... of course within The Matrix nothing is impossible if you believe you can do it. Keanu Reaves might not have the greatest acting range but he is just right for the role of Neo  a man understandably a little confused at finding everything he had experienced so far was unreal. Hugo Weaving is great as Agent Smith bringing a sense of menace to the role. Other main actors Carrie Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne also perform well. Writer/directors the Wachowski brothers did a great job; the film is incredibly stylish without lacking substance. I can't imagine many people haven't watched this but if you are one of those I strongly recommend checking it out.,positive

They lived up to their billing. Unfortunately  the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours  a bit too secular-minded for me  although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.Nonetheless  because of the stylish visuals and effects  it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best  or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard. Once again here's a movie that made you glad VHS tapes were being phased out in favor of sharper  widescreen transfers.,positive

Of course I have seen it before  back in the day when it was newly released. But I can't claim to have been much of a fan of the movie or the whole franchise actually. But I opted to sit down and watch them again  prior to sitting down to watch the newest addition to the franchise. But more about that one later.I never got onboard the 'Matrix is an amazing movie' train. Sure  I found the movie to be watchable  but it just wasn't an impressive movie in terms of script and storyline. So writers Lilly Wachowski and Lana Wachowski didn't really impress me back in 1999  and nor was revisiting the movie here in 2021 an eye-opening experience. I just never could delve into that whole artificial reality where the laws of physics and such doesn't apply.Visually then ""The Matrix"" was impressive  no doubt about it. And even today  22 years later  the movie is actually still rather enjoyable in terms of visual effects and CGI. But a movie can only be sustained so much on visual effects alone.Something that definitely was impressive about ""The Matrix"" was the cast ensemble  because they had gotten together a great cast for the movie. Of course  Keanu Reeves is excellent in the movie  but then again  he does tend to have a track record of that. The movie also have the likes of Laurence Fishburne  Carrie-Anne Moss  Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano on the cast list. Now  back in the day I didn't really like Hugo Weaving  but I must admit that seeing the movie again definitely brings his monotonous performance of Agent Smith to a new light  because he did so rather phenomenally  and always was the star of the movie.I am not a fan of ""The Matrix"" franchise  nor will I ever become so. But I have to say that the amount of action in the movie and the execution of the action sequences was good  and the visual effects definitely helped to keep the movie afloat. But in terms of storyline and script  then ""The Matrix"" was sort of flawed and mundane.My rating of the 1999 action sci-fi from directors Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski lands on a six out of ten stars.",positive

My wife and I just watched this again on Blu-ray  even though we have seen it multiple times it still is captivating. Simply a marvelous movie  and some might make the case that this is the best movie ever made.This is a review of ""The Matrix"" on DVD.If you like sci-fi action movies  this is certainly one to watch  even to own. For what it is  I give it a ""10"". It kept me wide-eyed all the way through. I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing after my 20th viewing  sometime in the year 2015. (Update: it is now 2019  and I have seen it maybe 8 times  still a great  ground-breaking movie  I come away even more impressed each time. Simply one of the best and thought provoking movies ever made.)The DVD picture is perfect all the way through  and the 5.1 surround sound is quite thrilling. But  the ""extra"" features are a big reason to buy the DVD.One ""extra"" is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while the editor  special effects supervisor  and actor comment on their own reactions and explanations of various scenes.Another ""extra"" is playing the movie in normal mode where a white rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene was filmed  you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will take you to the ""behind the scenes"" shooting. Then the movie resumes.There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed.

The two movies have got a complicated but mesmerizing screenplay  astounding special effects and especially  a main character with two faces: Keanu Reeves. It means that at the beginning of the movie  he's introduced as someone who leads a peaceful but common life.

The sole weakness of the movie is the love affair between Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. The Wachowski brothers felt compelled to include this  maybe to give their movie  a Hollywood nature.An awesome science-fiction film that easily ranks among the best movies of the nineties.",negative

Not only in  the visual sense   but in storytelling  the way society is  and much more.  And  Keanu Reeves is almost good here.Reeves playes 2 people in one- Thomas A. Anderson  a regular Joe who is just working it today's society.  The other is Neo  a comuter hacker who has broken every single known computer hacking law.  But  he soon meets Morpheus  played with great mysticism and wiseness by Laurence Fishburne  who brings Neo down the rabbit hole to tell him the truth about the world; we are living in a world called the Matrix  which uses out brain energy to trun us into batteries.  Unbelieveable to be sure  but it is incredibly original story wise  as it sprawls into something every average movie goer can appreciate- hard boiled  visually and bloody packed action  gore and violence.The best part though is that this film breaks many boundaries in technology and (with it's 4 Oscars for editing  sound  sound editing and visual effects) and deserves every bit of credit it gets.  True  some might find the plot confusing and boring and true it isn't for all tastes.  But if you can like the story and the action  you've got the key to a fantastic picture  otherwise it is another action flick (great action never-the-less).

The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home  it would still lose something.

The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances.

It has a lot of great elements  but also has its flaws and one admires Nolan more for his ambition than his execution.Starting with the praises  'Interstellar' does look spectacular. It's majestically shot  seamlessly edited and boasts audacious set design and fantastic special effects. The music score from Hans Zimmer is perhaps his best effort for a Nolan film  it has subtlety but also an unnerving eeriness and haunting and heart-wrenching pathos. The sound effects and sound mixing are expertly managed and give a real sense of authenticity.'Interstellar' however has more than just being technically spectacular. It is thought-provoking and awe-inspiring frequently  with some fascinating ideas  and does have a lot of heart  making the emotional elements genuinely poignant. The Cooper/Murph relationship  which is really what takes centre stage  is beautifully done and often very heartfelt. Nolan directs with great ambition  strong direction of the actors and flawless technical command.Matthew McConaughey proves that his Best Actor Oscar for 'Dallas Buyers Club' wasn't a fluke  he holds everything together in a committed  charismatic and deeply felt turn. MacKenzie Foy matches him beautifully as does Jessica Chastain. Anne Hathaway is sassy and emotive  and there is fine support from John Lithgow and Michael Caine.However  'Interstellar' is overlong and  because of the wildly variable pacing and that the story doesn't quite have enough content to justify it  it feels it. The pacing is wildly variable as aforementioned  there are times where it's fine but there's some choppiness and stodginess too.Dialogue isn't a strong suit either  there are many times where it's thought-provoking and poignant  but too much of it also consists of confused and at times illogical science (the time and space stuff was convoluted sometimes)  forced sentiment and things being over-explained and preachy. Matt Damon's character felt thrown in and not particularly necessary  also somewhat silly  while the ending is far too idealistic and too falsely pat.Overall  less than stellar and was expecting much better. This said  'Interstellar' is often impressive and very beautiful (especially technically  though the central relationship was also beautifully realised). 6/10 Bethany Cox,positive

Thankfully it's better than the overrated GRAVITY  but INTERSTELLAR soon turns out to be overrated in turn. It seems that as soon as a film comes out these days with a half intelligent premise  critics and audiences lap it up and rate it as one of the best ever. INTERSTELLAR is far from that. It has plenty of interesting moments  but the overlong running time is padded and bloated with endless sentimentalism and extraneous characters.It also takes a heck of a lot of time for anything to actually happen. Matthew McConaughey is all earnestness as the protagonist and comes across as a dullard; Anne Hathaway's character is completely extraneous and lacking in charisma. Only old timers like John Lithgow and Michael Caine shine  although Wes Bentley is underutilised in his role. An unexpected appearance from Matt Damon is undoubtedly the story's highlight.For much of the running time this follows the template of a typical space adventure  but around the middle part of the film it starts to get weighed down with endless CGI effects and the whole end part of the production gets muddled and predictable in equal measure  coming across like a rip off of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY but not nearly as good.,negative

Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former astronaut pilot who has turned to farming like everybody else. He and his daughter Murph find an underground NASA site run by Dr. John Brand (Michael Caine). Brand calculates that the blight will wipe out mankind in a generation. He is working on plans to save humanity after wormholes have been discovered leading to other worlds. Coop goes on a mission with Brand's daughter Dr. Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway)  Romilly and Doyle. However the mission runs into problems of relativity and sabotage. Meanwhile Murph (Jessica Chastain) grows up and tries to finish the calculations by Brand.I have problems with the setup to this movie. The idea that everybody needs to turn into farmers seems laughable. There are all kinds of problems with the start. The blight seems to be a catch-all for Nolan to use as a tool to explain away whatever he needs. It's inelegant and clunky. Apparently  science is not necessary anymore in this world. It's not like this dystopian world has run out of oil. A lot of it seems unlikely.Once McConaughey goes up into space  the movie gets better. It has touches of 2001 but generally  it is more like 2010. There are still some problems with unlikely human reactions. The whole conflict between Tom and Murph seems overblown. It's trying to up the drama without setting it up properly. I like McConaughey's side of the story. I would have preferred to stay mostly with him and lose some of Chastain's. I'm afraid the time relativity ideas may be lost on some of the audience. Even the best parts of the movie do have some nagging questions. It is still an awesome movie despite its problems. Although  I thought he might turn into a space baby at the end.,negative

From reading previous user comments  it seems that people give this movie a ten or a one (really?!). While this movie is  at times  a little confusing in the implications of time and space  it is still quite challenging and interesting. Earth is dying. Technology and war are blamed for the current conditions. Apparently  because of some serious dust  crops are slowly being destroyed. Also  the dust presents health hazards. The solution is to find a way to get people to a new place...or...to let the chips fall and send a few into space to inhabit a new planet or asteroid or moon or whatever  and start the whole thing over. A group of people who have maintained NASA (which is now seen as the deceivers of mankind) are building ships to explore the possibilities. The problem has to do with a limited time to manage this because of the laws of relativity. I thought it sort of devolved in a kind of sentimental mess  but the presentation of the problem is worth a viewing. There is some preachiness here which I find a bit hard to take  and a couple stated lessons that an eighth grader would know  let alone these experts. But it did keep my interest. One short criticism: It is way too long.,positive

He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuarón with Gravity  he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference  however is that a large part of his movie  including the first 40 minutes or so completely  plays down on Planet Earth. However  it is also about survival in space  including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate.This is like our generation's ""Armageddon""  only that it is much better and much more edge-of-the-seat. The lead character is played by Matthew McConaughey  whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an Academy Award win. ""Interstellar"" is much more than Sci-Fi though. I personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. The water planet sequence was incredibly well done. And right afterward  when Cooper (McConaughey) sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents  it is truly moving as well. I had a lump in my throat just like I did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. The inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first  but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really.Then  I also had a love-hate relationship with the Matt Damon parts. I found it pretty boring to be honest initially  but when we found out about his true intentions  it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. Nicely done. When Caine's character mentioned him with high praise early on  I felt there could be something fishy (like with Pixar's Up) there and yes it was. The ending of the movie with Hathaway's character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. Saving Private... ehh I mean Dr. Brand. Who knows? The time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. Somehow  the NASA lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in American school books. It is some point in the future. That much we know. David Oyelowo plays a small role here as one of the teachers. He has ""Selma"" in the race for an Academy Award nomination this year.The ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion  but I still liked it. The whole ghost explanation about Cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. The effects are brilliant of course  but that does not really need be mentioned for Nolan movies. A given. Hans Zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from McConaughey's charm (if you like that) and some droll robot creatures. Anyway  I found the film interesting enough that I found it a bit sad they did not get to visit the third planet (with Hathaway's character's lover)  only the water planet and the ice planet. I'd have loved to see that. However  maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. The movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the three-hour mark. It could have run for another hour and I probably would not have been bored. There really was hardly anything wrong with it. Affleck's character did not do too much for me. He wasn't particularly well-acted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to Chastain's character: the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to Cooper. John Lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always.This is one of the movies I really recommend to watch  preferably on the big screen due to its sensational visual aspects. It's also good for a rewatch I believe  also to evaluate the characters' actions  especially Caine's for example. And the story of course. I believe  after one viewing  I am still far away from having understood everything that was going on  especially the scientific aspects. That however  does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the film's great acting and emotional impact. If you are interested in space  you really have to see this too. It has distant planets  wormholes  black holes  spaceships and a lot more. Let me finish this review with two little snippets: First  the actress who played Murph as a child was the same that played Renesmee in the last two Twilight movies and  secondly  that fittingly Hathaway's character was called Amelia like the aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. That can't be coincidence  can it? Especially with her last shot.",positive

The reason for this mixed reaction I guess if that it is a very mixed bag of a film  and I can see why people love it  hate it  and a bit of both. The plot sees a series of unexplained events bringing a farmer and former pilot into a group looking to save humanity from the earth  which is currently killing itself and threatening to take mankind with it. Looking to the stars  in particular a black hole which seems to have been placed nearby to allow for travel to much more distant worlds  he learns of previous missions to scout out other planets on the other side  and that he is needed to lead a mission to follow up the promising leads  leaving his family behind potentially forever.To get it out of the way  there is a lot not to like about the film. It runs very long  and at some points this almost seems deliberate – like it has to be a certain length to be able to be called an epic. It also has variable pacing and plotting across this time  with some elements not making logical sense without even having to nitpick on technical details. However  while it doesn't all come together  the film is no less beautiful for what it does while it is trying to do it all. The visual effects are stunning  with believable space travel and worlds created  to the point that although a lot of it is technobabble  you do tend to go along with it and accept everything being laid out. Just as important as the technical  visionary stuff  is that the film has a very human heart throughout. It is surprisingly emotional  even when in the context of pure sci-fi elements; you do tend to buy characters as people  with their flaws  their pain  their motivations – it is surprising how strong the film is in this regard.Part of this working is that the performances are universally strong  although to just pick one – Mathew McConaughey is really great throughout. His down-to-earth elements bring the viewer into the film  while he completely nails the emotional content  which again helps convince us of the reality of the situation and passage of time – because we see how it hits his character  so it must be real. The director marshals all this in a feast for the eyes  heart  and brain – it doesn't all work  like I say  and it is far from being the perfect  flawless film that some would suggest  but it is engaging  thoughtful  heartfelt  and very well made.,negative

It seems somebody has deliberately placed a wormhole out in space near Saturn that leads us to another galaxy where there are some earth-like planets...maybe. Yes  in this near future world NASA has been able to solve suspended animation and create a ship to transport people to Saturn and beyond  start colonizing planets and be able to send signals back through the wormhole...but they can't green Mars.Now the science behind it is an extrapolation of what we know and believe theoretically  except for maybe that library scene which I found very very hard to swallow  but it was the climax of the film. It was needed to bring the film full circle. Many people will get lost in the science as they toss around terms. Yes  let's send a robot through the event horizon of the black hole so we can get the missing gravitational data we need to fill the gap in our anti-gravity quantum physics calculation...which we can immediately make into something to transport the human population. I had more problem with the practicality of applying the science then the science itself.They go to one planet landed on by Miller. They called it Miller's planet. Then they go to landed on by Mann  apparently it was a Mann's world too. Not to reveal more than the trailer  The question in the film is about how much would an individual sacrifice to save the species in the future. The underlying question screams about how we are killing the planet for the future  but are not willing to sacrifice anything in carbon emissions now.

It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way)  it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others  where it's heading (no pun intended)  but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic  might not be too far stretched  but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though.

The movie's out  what  a week or so as I write this  and IMDb voters have it ranked the 11th best movie of all time!!?? If there's justice in a rational world this would never happen. But it's not a rational world anymore now  is it  when an MIT professor can be found on tape explaining how the President's signature health care law was built on lies and deceit  and the media isn't even interested in covering the story.I could rant on but what's the point. I guess if your name is Nolan  any movie that comes out with the director's fingerprints on it will be hailed as monumental. I don't have a beef with Nolan personally  I think he makes some visually fantastic films (this is one to be sure)  but most of the time I think the hype precedes the product and then everyone else falls in line singing the praises.Case in point - ""Interstellar"". Nominally a sci-fi thriller  the picture devolves into something of a time travel anomaly that leaves the viewer scratching their head when hero Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) finds himself on the wrong side of the bookshelves in one of the picture's pivotal moments. I'm sitting there thinking 'this is what I came to see the movie for'? I'm not even going to start on Coop's selection to save the planet just by showing up at Professor Brand's (Michael Caine) facility. Which by the way  didn't it start out as some shack in the desert? When we get a tour of the place  it's got NASA central looking like a global conglomerate.Speaking of which  how is it NASA's still around for this massive undertaking to repatriate all of Earth's citizens to another planet? Unless I'm mistaken  NASA's primary goal now is Muslim outreach and all the best and brightest brains have farmed out. My head is starting to hurt.It was a small theater crowd last night  and I usually don't do this  but since a gentleman ahead of me held the door as I filed out  I asked him what he thought of the movie. His exact words were ""That was a piece of excrement""  only he used the more colloquially popular term for excrement. I wouldn't go that far  but if one hour in the wormhole equals seven years of Earth time  you're going to get old real fast trying to understand this picture.",negative

Basically  in the near future Earth is facing the extinction of the human race due to drought  famine and extreme climate change. Widowed former science engineer and NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) runs a farm with his father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow) and lives with teenage son Tom (Timothée Chalamet) and ten year old daughter Murphy ""Murph"" (The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn's Mackenzie Foy)  she believes her room is haunted  the ""ghost"" she and Cooper discover is communicating through gravitational waves  leaving binary coordinates in dust. These coordinates direct Cooper to a secret NASA installation led by Professor John Brand (Sir Michael Caine)  there may be hope for the human race to survive; a wormhole  created by alien intelligence  discovered in the further reaches of the solar system  leading to another galaxy  surrounding the black hole Gargantua three potentially habitable worlds have been identified  named Miller  Edmunds  and Mann  after scientists who surveyed them. Cooper is recruited to pilot the spacecraft Endurance to explore these planets  if one of them can sustain life then humanity will follow in space stations  but this means he will be away from home for many years  but this mission is important  Murph is devastated by his departure  they part on bad terms. On Endurance  Cooper is joined by Brand's biologist daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway)  scientists Romilly (Cloud Atlas's David Gyasi) and Doyle (American Beauty's Wes Bentley)  and robots TARS (voiced by The Grinch's Bill Irwin) and CASE (voiced by Josh Stewart)  the scientists go into hibernation while the craft travels towards the black hole  once close they awake and try to withstand the turbulent effects. The first head to planet Miller  but it being so close to Gargantua means it experiences severe gravitational time dilation: every hour on the surface is seven years on Earth  it is inhospitable  being covered by shallow ocean that experiences enormous tidal waves  Amelia tries to recover data  but Doyle is killed and departure is delayed  returning to the shuttle Cooper and Amelia find 23 years has passed. Back on Earth  adult Murph (Zero Dark Thirty's Jessica Chastain) is now a NASA scientist assisting Brand with his equation to enable NASA to launch the massive space station  near death Brand admits he already solved the problem and determined it is an impossible project  he covered this up and put faith in ""Plan B"": using fertilised embryos to start humanity anew  however Murph says the equation could work with additional data from a black hole's singularity. The Endurance only has enough fuel to visit one more planet  after a tense vote they decide Mann is best  however landing they find it is icy and inhospitable  they do however find Dr. Mann (Matt Damon) in hibernation  awoken he tells everything he knows about the mission  he knew ""Plan B"" was the true goal  he faked data to be rescued. In a moment of madness Mann breaks Cooper's spacesuit visor and leaves him to die  fleeing to Endurance on a shuttle  Romilly is killed by a bomb Mann planted  Amelia rescues Cooper and they get to Endurance  just as Mann docks improperly and causes the airlock to explode  serious damage is caused  but Cooper gets Endurance under control using the shuttle. Nearly out of fuel Cooper and Amelia plan to slingshot Endurance around Gargantua towards Edmunds  Cooper sacrifices himself with TARS to collect data on the singularity  detaching into the black hole and propelling Amelia by dropping the ship's mass  Cooper and TARS enter an extra-dimensional ""tesseract""  where time appears as a spatial dimension and portals show glimpses of Murph's childhood bedroom at various times. Cooper realises the alien beings may be human from the future who have constructed this space for him to communicate with Murph and save humanity  the coordinates from previously were in fact Cooper himself  finding adult Murph in the ""tesseract"" he uses gravitational waves to encode TARS's data on the singularity into Murph's watch  with this she solves Brand's equation and the process of evacuating Earth begins  the ""tesseract"" is closed and Cooper ejected from Gargantua back into the Solar System near Saturn. Time dilation from the entire mission means that humans have evolved to become an advanced space faring race  Cooper is found by a space police vehicle before his oxygen level drops  he wakes on-board ""Cooper's Station""  he explores the alternative world  and he reunites with elderly Murph (The Exorcist's Ellen Burstyn) who led the exodus of humanity  she advises Cooper and TARS to search for Amelia  who has begun preparation on the planet Edmunds. Also starring Casey Affleck as adult Tom Cooper  Spider-Man 3's Topher Grace as Getty  The Last King of Scotland's David Oyelowo as School Principal and William Devane as Williams. McConaughey holds it together well as the forthright pilot into space  Hathaway is good being informative  Chastain does well as the angry but important daughter  Damon is a welcome surprise  and Caine gets his moments as the wild old man. The majority of the film has similar scale and vision to 2001: A Space Odyssey  utilising fantastic special effects for spectacular visuals and extra-terrestrial worlds  I can see elements of Silent Running as well  it does get soppy towards the end with a concept like Contact (coincidentally also starring McConaughey)  but overall it is a majestic space film with plenty to offer  including heart  a worthwhile science-fiction adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects  and it was nominated for Best Music  Original Score for Hans Zimmer  Best Sound Mixing  Best Sound Editing  and Best Production Design  it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects  and it was nominated for Best Cinematography  Best Original Music  and Best Production Design  and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score.

His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing back on Earth.This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension  including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey  who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway  who plays Amelia Brand a scientist aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain  who play the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great  as one would expect in a film from Christopher Nolan  and I was pleased that space was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration.Overall I'd recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of '2001 – A Space Odyssey' although this has more emotion to it than that classic.,positive

I will agree with them for the most parts. It is a beautiful movie and it has a captivating storyline. Well  right up to the point where Cooper went into the Black hole. Then it just turned ludicrous.However  from the way I had been told about the story in ""Interstellar"" I had expected a bit more from it. I found it to be a bit too brisk in getting past most of the events that took place throughout the course of the movie.The effects in the movie were really good and came off as being believable  which really worked in favor of the movie  obviously. And the acting was also quite good  even with Matt Damon in it.There are some interesting elements in the storyline  I just wish that Nolan would have put more emphasis on the science and theoretical aspects of the movie's storyline; in regards of black holes  wormholes  relativity theory  etc.All in all  an enjoyable movie for sure  but for me it just wasn't as grand and epic as most people had made it out to be.",positive

Interstellar is so far up itself that it actually transcends all the laws of cinema and proves to be a rather enjoyable piece of big-budget baloney as a result.For starters  we get Matthew McConaughey's farmer Cooper  who is chosen to pilot NASA's only spacecraft  despite having spent the last decade or so growing corn. Then we get two of science-fiction's most aesthetically awkward robots in the form of A.I. units TARS and CASE. After flying through a worm-hole  Cooper lands his spacecraft in several inches of water and then surfs a massive tidal wave. We see a planet so cold that its clouds are solid ice. We have a mad scientist who rants about the human instinct for survival while head butting Cooper with his space helmet. Although Michael Caine's character spans 23 years  he doesn't look a day older than when we first see him (his voice just gets a bit hoarse  but not Batman hoarse). And Cooper enters a black hole where he ends up behind a 5-dimensional bookcase that allows him to manipulate gravity to send a message to his daughter via wristwatch!!!And that's just the stuff I can recall right now (it's waaay past my bed-time and I'm very tired).If only there had been a few ninjas  some gratuitous female nudity (perhaps a race of insatiable  sexy alien maidens with over-sized breasts)  a planet of space zombies  and a laser battle  this would have been the perfect so-bad-it's-good movie.7/10: it's too wonderfully silly for me too hate on it as much as I really should.,positive

This movie  ""Interstellar""  is my kind of movie. I saw it at home on Blu-Ray.As one would expect for this type of movie the picture and sound are both superb  and many times the deep  rumbling bass rattled the fireplace grill and the framed posters on my wall. It is long  at 2 hours and 45 minutes to the closing credits  but every minute was attention-grabbing. I will watch it again.The setting is the future  not too distant  and Matthew McConaughey is former Astronaut Cooper  now a corn farmer. Where he lives are recurring giant dust storms  a barometer of how close the planet Earth is to no longer being able to support human life. Everyone is worried but also busy surviving.Cooper also has a bright 10-yr-old daughter and together they make sense of some strange happenings in her bedroom  books falling off the shelves  dust making patterns  they figure out some coordinates that take them to the top secret location of the remaining NASA headquarters. In secret they have been developing a space ship capable of going to the outer reaches of the Solar system to encounter a wormhole  they think put there by intelligent beings  to allow passage into a distant system that may have planets that can support human life. Cooper is needed as pilot for the mission  not knowing if he will ever return to his family.One of the scientists making the trip is Anne Hathaway as Brand  daughter of the old scientist leading the project. Plus several others. There is an intelligent robot with Bill Irwin as the voice of TARS. (As an aside  Irwin had a recurring role on the old TV series 'Northern Exposure' and his presence here brought back fond memories.)So the whole story gets pretty complicated and cannot always follow good science. Still it is extremely well presented  with a totally novel ending. Writer/director Nolan borrows from his ""Inception"" bag of tricks  when every hour on a planet near a black hole is like 7 years back home  so everyone on Earth ages far ahead of the crew. Really  really good movie.SPOILERS: (For my own recollection.) In the end Cooper and his ship are being sucked into a black hole  the ship is being ripped apart  he ejects and  instead of being consumed he ends up in a type of matrix behind the walls and bookshelves of his daughter's room  he can see her  he realizes it was actually him who those years earlier had given her the signals. Forward to a few years later  he is on an orbiting sanctuary  while he contemplates joining Brand now on a new planet trying to colonize it.",positive

It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note  Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think.,positive

He is chosen to travel to the uncharted parts of the space in search for a new habitable planet.""Interstellar"" is a long film  and the first two hours of it does not seem like a typical Christopher Nolan film. Most of the scenes are (literally) down to Earth  with no fancy visual effects. It spends much time building up the story  telling the story of a father and his daughter who sees 'ghost' in her bedroom. Through this ghost  one thing led to another  and the man is in space. When the film is not down on Earth  it looks more like a disaster film. The first adventure is a spectacular feat involving water. It also introduces the physics of relativity  on how time slows down in another world  leading to a misguided decision of the astronauts in retrospect. This sets the foundation for future plot involving more relativity.As the film progresses  there is more adventure  both in the form of adrenaline pumping adventure and humanity and integrity testing conditions. Matt Damon's character forms a central subplot that makes me reflect on what lengths would people go in order to achieve a certain goal. It reflects on the reality that people are driven by egocentric instincts. It is not a pretty truth  but it tells that human are not idealistic creatures.The final half an hour is what a typical Christopher Nolan film is like. It makes me hold my breath because it is so intense  both emotionally and cognitively. The ending gives me inexplicable exhilaration. Things come to a full circle  and it is filled with joy.It is not a film for everyone  as the story is long and takes a lot of time to build. Two people walked out of the cinema an hour into the film  and someone sitting behind me remarked after the film ended that he opined it was the most boring Christopher Nolan film ever.

A can't miss movie!,08-Nov-14,Christopher Nolan directs an enthralling space odyssey  co-written with his brother Jonathan. This movie lives up to the hype and is one not to be missed. The earth is chocking as it is a starving Dirt Bowl. The future is dim as farmers are producing less and less to feed the population. Cooper(Matthew McConaughey)is a former test pilot and widower raising two children  fifteen year old Tom(Timothee Chalamet) and ten year old Murph(Mackenzie Foy)  who is suspended from school for fighting. She refuses to believe the school books being right  saying the Apollo missions were faked in order to bankrupt Russia's space program.Cooper and daughter stumble across the remnants of the believed to be defunct NASA  where Professor Brand(Michael Caine) convinces Cooper he is the only one to command a mission to be launched into space in search of a new planet that can sustain life. The flight must enter a wormhole that will warp time  but allow a crew to rescue data from explorers  who preceded them. A member of Cooper's mission is Brand's daughter(Anne Hathaway). Deep on the mind of Cooper's daughter is the fact that if and when her father makes it back to earth  he will be the same age or older than her due to the time warp.No little green men  no aliens in sight. There are a couple of highly intelligent computerized robots  so to speak. Visually awesome and enhanced by Hans Zimmer's score. McConaughey seems driven and invested. Young Miss Foy is very watchable. And Jessica Chastain is excellent in the role of the adult Murph. Also in the cast: John Lithgow  Wes Bently  Matt Damon  William Devane  Casey Affleck and Ellen Burstyn. Plus the voices of Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart. INTERSTELLAR is stellar!,positive

Again  we have a powerful narrative arc that shifts in unexpected and engages in expected ways.The device is hackneyed: messages from the future  but is handled deftly. Where it is clumsy  we are competently distracted by narrative and visual process. The love story that drives this is novel enough to not fall into one of the three formulas commonly used for 'love ' (despite McConaughey) or two for father-rescues-daughter. We have a chosen child who saves the world by supernatural intervention  but again  this doesn't distract. These accomplishments alone make this worth experiencing because many devices are used to reset our expectations from formulas. Some fail horribly and that keeps this film from my absolute essential viewing list; I'll get to those in a moment. But all that are under the control of the filmmaker are so well considered that they bear mention.Take  for example the visual setting. The story itself is about the folding of time  but in a subtle way. The time of the story is in the future  but the setting is in the past. We refer to the dustbowl. All the cars  buildings  clothes and verbal expressions are vaguely from that era. We never see a brand that would pin down the time.More powerfully  the film itself is made as a science fiction film would be in the 50s-60s  using notions and tropes from that era. The robot is from ""Forbidden Planet."" The notion that a world-saving enterprise rests on the mathematical attempts of one man alone. That a vast enterprise is actually secret and located in one spot  with no suppliers. That construction of a spaceship requires welding sparks. That a heavy lift launch can occur in a building.Look at the computer screens. Nearly all are commandline interfaces. The switches and control panels are from the DEW line era. They haven't managed to use legacy fonts in the signage  but it looks like they avoided the most obvious: helvetica.Even the drone is a currently obsolete model. Underscoring all this is setting the film in Texas. Malick  and before him Bogdanovich  Hooper  Welles exploited the fact that Texas lives in two eras  sucking riches from the present while defining itself in some fictitious and better past.The film is also clearly in a future  after antiscience politicians have written technology out of the textbooks  denying the moon landing and forcing something named NASA underground. The ambiguity of time is conveyed subconsciously and works. I think they used some recorded interviews from the actual dustbowl era.But the flaw  the underlying decay in this film is in who they relied on for the science. They clearly separated the science of the adopted genre (noted above) from the science used in the actual extraterrestrial events. They chose renown physicist Kip Thorne as their authority.The man is an important scientist and reportedly very engaging. But the world of such scientists is divided between those who believe in the primary eminence of geometry and those who believe instead in ordered mechanics. This is a deep divide  highly polarized when the work gets going. Which is better for the problems at hand is irrelevant here. But which is better for cinematic depictions of encounters with the forces of the world well there is no contest and Noland chose unwisely. I may write about this. A good title may be the Carl Sagan effect.On other unrelated matters  some unresolved minor plot threads remain. The finished film exceeded the time budget for story-before-launch as it is  but we'd like to know what the reason for introducing the drone was and why it was important.A bit worse: In the film  we have a very hard won ability to send messages back in time  describing deep science from inside a black hole. I get that. But 'before' all those events  some other souls sent back messages and the physical artifact of the wormhole. Why not use that mechanism  unless the much-mentioned notion of the urges of love are essential to the bridge?",positive

What About Plot Holes ?,29-Mar-15,One of my all time favourite novels is The Death Of Grass by the late John Christopher . Written in 1956 it tells off a virus that destroys the cereal crops of Asia   Africa and Europe plunging most of humanity in to famine . It was adapted by Cornel Wilde in a 1970 film called NO BLADE OF GRASS   a very bleak and hard hitting film but one that was also painfully disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying . That said the power of the premise is clear to see and one has high hopes it will be remade one day . Along comes Christopher Nolan a director so highly regarded that if he did a selfie on his I-phone then that clip would automatically find itself on the IMDb Top 250 film list and he takes the premise of The Death Of Grass as a plot device and manages to make a film far more unconvincing than Cornel Wilde's movie not t mention far more expensive As I said humanity is being starved in to extinction and live on a diet of corn . Being set in the American mid-West corn is obviously easy to come by but would this be true of other people living on other continents ? I'm not a farmer or a geologist but surely there's a good reason why some countries have a staple diet of wheat while other countries have a staple diet of rice ? Perhaps the countries that no longer can grow wheat now grow root vegetables as their staple diet ? I suppose you've got to join up the dots for yourself but it's rather annoying the way the rest of the world goes unmentioned almost as though the film makers have failed to think the scenario through properly . Especially later where mankind seems to be facing greater dangers from sand storms than famine Some other things the makers haven't thought through with the film In this near future world armies no longer exist ? A noble ideal perhaps but surely if a nation state exists so would an army if only to protect itself from other nation states ? It's official - everyone thinks the Moon landings were faked . I can see Nolan having a dig at creationism being taught in American schools but this ties in with another plot turn NASA still exists as a secretive organization ! Right so the government agency that sent men to the Moon and back exists as a real though somewhat underground organization and yet everyone thinks the Moon landings are faked ? Can't see the logic behind this . It also adds more confusion when ...NASA send the protagonists to a wormhole just off Jupiter . It's never revealed if these space journeys have US government approval but if not why would a government scrap standing armies and not totally shut down an agency that can send people to the ends of the solar system if you're going to teach conspiracy theories in school ? In reality it also be technically and monetary prohibitive for an agency to do this without government approval   Certainly internal logic and continuity is not the films strong point . It's also a film that's over long and contains an ending straight out of the more prentious episodes of SPACE 1999 This is a pity because it's more than competent on a technical level and I can see Nolan is trying to make an intelligent space epic that will try and grab the audiences attention and fire up their passion for real life science . Unfortunately he's left out the intelligence in crafting a drama and when this fails so does everything else,positive

Here  Not so Much.The Overt and Heavy Handed Sentimentality was better Restrained in ""Contact"" (1997). The unnecessarily Complicated and Thick Script reminds of ""Inception"" (2010). It tends to Confuse more than impress.It seems  when Matthew Mcconaughey asked the Director for Motivation He was told to Whisper and Mumble. The other Stars that Show up are OK if Nothing Special  although when Matt Damon wakes it Provides the Film with one of the better Pieces of Space-Drama.There are a few Good Lines...""Humanity was born on Earth but not meant to stay here."" and ""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars  now we just look down and worry about are place in the dirt."" But the Overwritten Science-Babble and Over-Complicated Plot seems to try and Impress those Viewers that Think that ""The 5th Dimension"" is a Singing Group.A few Interesting and Artistic Scenes that are Outstanding  like the ""Library"" are what makes the Film rise Above Mediocre. But there's a lot of Technological Stuff considering the Time Frame and Events that really are Strange and Bewildering. The Social behavior that got Humans to turn the Planet into a Dust-Bowl isn't Even Mentioned. Gravity  not the Movie  the other thing  is Mentioned Frequently. It's Worth a Watch but is mostly Disappointing and highly Derivative in both Style and Concept. Science-Fiction  Contrary to most Haters of this thing  does not have to Obey Current Knowledge. It can  and often does  come from Made Up Stuff from Creative Minds. Directors and Writers are Free to Explore anything They can Imagine. That's why it is called Science ""Fiction"".

It seems that that life on Earth might not survive due to to some unexplained environmental disaster. Naturally nothing goes right.WAY overpraised and terrible sci-fi movie. When I heard the plot from this I expected the worst. Writer/director Christopher Nolan has never been a favorite for me--I HATE what he did to Batman in his movie trilogy. I thought that he as trying to imitate Stanley Kubrick (""2001"") here but it's far worse--he's doing Steven Spielberg! The movie runs WAY too long (165 minutes) and they're constantly pushing family friendly values in your face. Cooper's non-stop yammering about his daughter got on my nerves instantly. Also that stupid fake southern accent he adopts is immediately annoying. The story is very slow and all the characters are cardboard cutouts you've seen in other movies. The special effects are flawless and there's some beautiful cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really weigh it down. Any sort of statement they're trying to make on time and life is completely deadened by the script. Also this movie is very manipulative and way too sentimental. They go out of their way to make the audience cry--like at a Spielberg movie. Well I did cry--tears of joy at the end that this was over! Also the gaps in logic and plot holes here are very annoying. I lost track of how many times I rolled my eyes at the dubious ""logic"" served up here. The acting was as good as it could be (I guess) but  at the end  they throw in a surprise guest star (who I won't name). It didn't help because I think he's a terrible actor and this didn't change my mind. I was bored and looked at my watch MANY times while this played. It's boring  obvious and manipulative.

Take the opening. We're in East Jesus in the heart of the dust bowl. An ordinary family  a wooden home one step up from a tarpaper shack. Inside an equally ordinary kitchen THEN  in the bedroom of the daughter of the house  Murph  we find FLOOR-TO-CEILING BOOKSHELVES? Fully stocked. You're putting me on  right  Chris. More? Seems the father of Murph is an ex pilot who has retired to become a farmer. No real problem there BUT  he and Murph stumble on some co-ordinates and follow them to a top-secret NASA base where the head honcho is Professor Michael Caine. They show the intruder the latest space-ship  explain that earth is running out of food and the only solution is to find a planet that will sustain human life AND THEN invite him to lead the mission. This is a guy who hasn't flown in x amount of years and may or may not be in shape. There is no training programme  no vetting  the whole thing resembles a car salesman offering someone who walks in off the street a chance to test drive the latest top-of-the-range Lamborghini. If you can get past this nonsense you may well enjoy what follows. Unlike  say  Gravity  which was virtually one hundred per cent in space  Intersteller does introduce a human element and is all the better for it. Clearly the Nolans are interested in exploiting technology at the expense of constructing an even halfway plausible screenplay and there are probably enough overgrown schoolboys out there who will respond to cgi the way Pavlov's dog responded to a bell.,positive

At 2 and a half hours you'd better strap in for the long haul. And with the musical score the movie is like one long piano concerto. There was not a moment too trivial for a portentous musical moment.Interstellar is about time  space and saving humanity. All three of these items are connected. In the near future man is on the brink of extinction because nothing will grow. The only viable solution is to leave Earth behind and start anew on a new planet. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) volunteers to pilot an extremely risky mission to another galaxy in search of mankind's new home.This movie involves science  astronomy  physics  and a lot of other high level stuff that makes people like me say ""whoa you guys are smart."" In between all of that were strong messages about love and family and unbreakable bonds. At times the movie was down right depressing and at other times it was uplifting and at all times it seemed to try to pull tears out of you.This movie had elements of so many movies before it: Contact  Signs  Abyss  Elysium but it never truly mimicked anyone of them.

Obviously  she loved the film as well. As for me  I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you  I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in ""The Avengers"". Specifically  the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia  it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film.

True  the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye  whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten  that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great  a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki  though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man  Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury  Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton)  Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest  heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too  Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional  imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here  Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed)  in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour  pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script  filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall  Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it  and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant  just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox,positive

I went into it expecting not to like it much  and indeed the first hour seemed to me middling at best: some mildly lame comedy  a whole lot of posturing  and a silly storyline involving silly characters.Then things changed. They started to pick up  and the action started hitting home. Then all hell broke loose with a climax that felt like it lasted a whole hour  an hour packed with kaiju-style mayhem as New York found itself subjected to an alien invasion. And I was wowed. Never before has it been possible to depict such constant  wide-scale mayhem  but with the improvement of CGI technology it's finally up there on screen with all of its glory.And yes  I ended up liking MARVEL'S AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. What's not to like  really? The whole feel is kept light and there are so many larger-than-life characters that you end up having a ball with it regardless. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is my favourite character by far - Ruffalo is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana or Edward Norton - but Chris Evans's Captain America comes a close second. Sure  I see this film for what it is: a mindless piece of crowd-pleasing  overblown CGI mayhem  replete with a silly  buffoonish bad guy - but at the same time I can't help but getting caught up for the ride.,negative

I'll be honest and admit that comic book movies aren't my #1 type of film and it wasn't until just a month before THE AVENGERS opened that I bothered to check out the casts supporting movies. I enjoyed the two IRON MAN movies  thought THOR was very good  THE INCREDIBLE HULK was entertaining and I found CAPTAIN America to be decent but no matter what I felt about those films it couldn't prepare me for how much I enjoyed this one. Director Joss Whedon has created something incredibly special and you really can't help but think he's raised the super hero bar so high that many future films are going to have problems reaching it. When bringing all of these characters together  the filmmakers could have taken an easy route and just give us mindless action but that wasn't the case here as Whedon really delivered a deep but easy to follow story and he knew how to have fun with it. The constant banter between the superheroes could have led to some very unfunny moments but the screenplay was so smart in allowing each of their personalities to come through and then added the fun of taking those personalities and throw them at one another. This banter really turned into something incredibly funny and allowed for some great one-liners as well as some terrific action. When it comes to these type of movies I usually complain about a couple things. One is the obvious CGI but that wasn't a problem here because it just looked so realistic that it never took you out of the story and instead it put you more directly into it. Another thing I usually complain about in recent mainstream movies are the expanded running times. THE AVENGERS clocks in at 142-minutes  which made me nervous going in but it turns out that this film proves long running times are okay as long as you have enough to support it and this movie does. In fact  the long running time felt extremely short as the film flies by without any problems. Say what you will about comic adaptations but there's no question that THE AVENGERS is first rate entertainment thanks in large part to the great direction  the detailed writing and each of the performers fitting their roles and bringing them to life. This here is without question a complete success so future comic movie makers had better step their game up.,positive

Downey has already shown that he's a movie star. He could power a whole franchise all by himself but the Avengers is more than just a one man team. This is a quintessential Joss Whedon Scooby gang  and he's great at the snappy dialog and friend-hate comradry. This is a whole team of heroes working together.Because of its timing  this will be compared to The Dark Knight Rises. Most seems to give TDKR more credit because of its darker grittier tone. Both are great but I like Avengers better. Honestly  TDKR is inferior to TDK. There are logic problems with TDKR. There are too many comic-book moves in that film. It's melodramatic in its emotionally manipulations. The Avengers is simply better written. Its dialog is better. It may be simplistic but it's more fun.,positive

I'm still rating this pretty high because it is amazing to look at  the special effects are beyond belief  and some of the characters have some dimension. That said  I think I would need a manual to really get the true impact of each character  what his or her powers are  and how they fit together. There is always some evildoing bad guy who has some history with the others. This is what makes comics what they are (I read lots of comics as a kid  so I do understand the milieu). When you get right down to it  however  they seem to rely mostly on beating each other over the head with whatever is handy. It's like watching professional wrestling which is sort of comic bookish in its own way. It's a cast of characters what represent simple things  both good and evil. I'll leave these to the kids and continue to watch movies with complex characters and clever story lines.,negative

The director and co-writer was Joss Whedon  at that point mostly known for Buffy and Toy Story  the film that brought him an Oscar nomination. But now  this one here is certainly his career-defining work. The era of superhero blockbuster films had already started back then and RDJ's Iron Man franchise was going well enough for using his popularity to bring up a Marvel superhero all-stars film. Thor and Captain America of course have their own films now too. But back to this one here. Hiddleston was still doing a good job and Loki as a villain definitely does not get old too quickly. Some great potential this character has. Not a surprise at all  Whedon was also going for comedy next to the fantasy  drama and action sequences. Most of it was working out well like the restaurant scene at the very end. The only parts I did not like from the comedy perspective were probably the Tony Stark one-liner moments  but that's also subjective.This film was nominated for its special effects for a BAFTA and an Oscar and lost both times to Life of Pi. Of course  fitting the box office success  it received many other honors during the award season back then. At slightly over 140 minutes  it is a really long watch indeed and I think there were enough insignificant moments to stay under the 2-hour-mark. But I still take it as it is as there wasn't a great deal of dragging which is certainly a success for its duration. Back to the villain  Loki may have been the primary antagonist here  but there is a lot more conflict in here  most of all the Avengers managing to grow into a team that manages to hold their egos back a bit for the greater cause. It's a long way to that. And when it's finally done  Loki reappears by opening the gates to hell or the gates to the ""other end of the universe"" as they were saying. So what was the best thing here? Yes it may be the special effects work indeed as they helped the film nicely to overcome a few lengths. And I am not talking about the spectacular stuff like the explosions here  but also for example about the more subtle effects like what Iron Man sees written in his mask.So yeah  overall I think this was a good watch. Everybody will have their favorites from the cast  but as the film is so long  every bigger character gets his solid deal of screen time. For me  these would be Jackson  Renner and ScarJo of course  even if I must admit that SLJ's character did not do a whole lot for me in here. It's a film you want to watch when you are in for some pointless fun. It's of course not a realistic movie at all from start to finish  but it's still a success and not just in quality  but also definitely from the commercial perspective. No surprise number 3 is coming out soon. Still the IMDb and RT ratings may be a bit too high to be honest. Nonetheless  if you are not one of the million people who have seen and rated this blockbuster here on IMDb  it really is high time to finally go check it out. Today was the second (or third) time I watched it and I think it does not lose any of its appeal on rewatch. Go for it  especially if you like Marvel films. I give this first (new) Avengers film a thumbs-up. The character are really interesting and fun to watch  not just during their introduction in the first 45 minutes.",positive

The most obvious is that it is a big superhero summer blockbuster film – a type of film that is popular but all too often disappointing (indeed an accusation that could be levelled at films featuring characters in this film). Secondly though  a common problem with all the various character films leading up to this joint effort is that they generally struggled to make all the characters fit and you had the constant feeling that all the positioning and introductions were hurting the individual tales just for the sake of this joint one; so I did wonder how it was going to cope with all these characters running around in one place.Ironically enough though  the character balancing turns out to not be a massive problem in this case and I think it is partly because they do all exist as equals within the same plot lines  rather than being forced onto others. The plot is suitably overblown and involves an intergalactic threat rather than a man-made one; again this concerned me at first because I didn't particularly care for Thor and I did get the feeling that this would be more of the same  with gods and mythical creatures running around. To a point this was the case here because to the casual viewer (which I am)  these aliens aren't really known or understood but the film does make it work because it allows it to be just about serious enough to avoid spoof but at the same time generating sufficient fun so that you go along with it. In some ways it is the polar opposite of the other big superhero franchise out this summer (Batman) because where one aims for darkness and introspection  Avengers really has no interest and instead focuses on delivering fun and action in an easily accessible and enjoyable package.And this it does. Across all the characters we have good humour and banter which never undermines the action but rather adds to it  giving it a sense of fun that engages and helpfully prevents you questioning the detail too much or having things like specific comic banter stand out against the serious nature of the action. There are lots of nice comic touches and lines but for me Hulk randomly punching Thor was the high point (with the ""puny god"" moment being a very close second). The cast go with it and I liked that everyone did work together without any one specific character hogging too much of the screen. Downey Jr is fun as normal and he works well with Evans  who I thought was better here than he was in his own film. Likewise Hemsworth benefits from a bit of decent humour and fun (two things lacking in his own film) and Ruffalo makes for a good Hulk  again though he is helped by the lack of having to carry a whole film. Johansson and Renner are good in support and the rest of the cast features good turns from many familiar faces  none of whom get in the way but all contribute to the fun.It is easy to turn your nose up at Avengers because it is basically an effects-driven summer blockbuster about superheroes  nothing something that always delivers  but to do so would be to ignore the fact that there are good and bad examples of this and that The Avengers is one of the good ones. Colourful  busy  fun and generally very entertaining – it delivers everything it sets out to do and I found it very enjoyable for this.",positive

It would be such a great success and I would be so happy for Joss Wheddon. A real nerd amongst filmmakers he has made it big time. As we speak Avengers has broken quite a few records already and it is on a good roll. And all that is more than deserved. While I don't think it is necessary to have watched the other Marvel movies so far (especially not the different Hulks)  the Avengers will make you want to watch more (look at your local video store for confirmation!).All the characters are here and have their moments. Maybe Thor is the one that gets a bit shorthanded time wise. But then again  he is god  so he wouldn't care anyway. Mark Ruffalo is winning (as a Charlie Sheen would say) with his performance as Hulk/Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is entertaining as ever. And even if some claim that Captain America is not needed  I think he brings Gravitas and is more than valuable to counter the jokes of an Iron Man and bring some much needed bonding to the whole Crew. Chris Evans is perfect for that role.The movie has been criticized for the weak villain. I think that does injustice to the movie. While the characters (bar Hulk?) have been introduced to you  this still is a forming of a group. It is more about the Avengers  than it is about any villain. And I don't think Tom H. Loki is that weak (even if Hulk does disagree).I watched the movie twice now and I enjoyed it both times. Time flies by and you don't realize how fast 150 minutes can go by. I like the fact  that Joss does not treat the viewer as if he were stupid. So maybe some will not get the joke/bet between Capt. Americas character and Sam Jacksons character (though I reckon it won't be many)  but I loved that the movie did not make a big deal out of it.Since this is a Marvel movie  you should know by now that there is a tag scene coming at the end. A friend of mine knew immediately what (or rather who) we saw there. You'll find the answer on the internet. That scene came in between the credits. There is another scene after the credits which as of yet  was not shown in Europe  but will hopefully make its way onto a digital release (DVD  Blu Ray or whatever comes next). I'm so looking forward to it ... oh and the 3D is nice  but its the story/characters and everything else that will sell you to the movie ...,negative

I've been around since Stan Lee created Spider-Man  and some of the other Marvel super-heroes were around even before I was born. So I grew up at a time when the technology wasn't up to the task of putting what we see in today's Avengers on the big screen. With that said  it looks like what we have here is all sizzle and no steak. The CGI and special effects components of this flick makes it an all time blockbuster spectacle  so if that's what you're all about  you won't be disappointed. However if you're looking for a story with nuanced characters and an intriguing plot  you've come to the wrong movie. This is all about wringing out as much action and adrenaline pumping machismo that any fanboy could possibly ask for. So on that score it works  but I need something more  even in a super-hero movie.With that out of the way  there were some genuinely funny moments in the picture that added the slightest dimension to the principal characters. Of all the players  Robert Downey Jr. probably brings the greatest sense of professionalism to his portrayal of Iron Man. He's out there  he's serious when he has to be  and he's a wise guy when the situation warrants. As for the the CGI Hulk - who ever thought he'd wind up being the comedic sidekick in a story like this? He had at least two stellar moments that brought my theater to life  the rag doll whipping on old Loki (Tom Hiddleston)  and the sidearm swat to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) that was so outrageous it just brought the house down.Apart from some of the witty comic book dialog  the rest was all relentless and gratuitously destructive special effects  exceptionally well done of course  but gosh  how much can a city take? Which by the way  is never dealt with as part of the aftermath of a super-hero barrage when a cosmic power like Loki comes to town. How about a film where citizen action groups bring charges against Iron Man  Thor and Hulk for destroying their city? Just kidding - how are you going to get them to court? Say  I know Stan Lee missed a cameo or two along the way in these Marvel flicks  so I was glad to see he showed up here  even though it was probably his quickest one ever. If you blinked you missed it during the cable news roundup following the final battle. It's going to be a sad day when Lee won't be around any more to make these appearances.And now for my final rant - as I write this  ""The Avengers"" has  in just two days  made it to #31 on IMDb's list of Top 250 Films. My post will be #495  so in less than a full weekend  movie goers have vaulted this film to a rating right up there in between ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"". Doesn't it seem like there's something wrong with this picture? Personally  if I were making the rules  I'd allow all the reviews in the world right out of the gate for a new release  but withhold ratings on a picture for at least a year or two after it's come out. OK  maybe six months. I think that would take some of the distortion out of the rating system  and someone like Joss Whedon wouldn't have to go around being embarrassed by comparisons to truly great films.Back to ""The Avengers"" - stick around for the closing credits for a preview of the next mind blowing Avengers flick. You know they'll be there because Nick Fury said so. THANOS!!! You think they can destroy more property than you saw done in this film? I'd bet on it.",negative

""The Avengers"" (not to be confused with the 1960s TV series) is entertaining enough. It's nothing special - much of it is sensory overload - but it's nothing that it doesn't pretend to be. Loki is the common suave but malevolent villain. He could trick anyone into thinking that he's a decent person. This movie will definitely please the Leonard Hofstadters  Sheldon Coopers  Howard Wolowitzes and Raj Koothrapalis of the world.It was a pleasant surprise to see that one of the people in the World Security Council got played by Jenny Agutter (the nurse in ""An American Werewolf in London"").

Currently  it sits at an 8.3 and is said to be the 140th greatest film of all time. Now  no matter how good you think it is  does anyone seriously believe it is one of the greatest films ever made? I mean  really? I grew up reading comic books  so the films are a bit of a different experience for me than they are for others. I think the movies have the comic fans as their biggest base  which is good  because otherwise several references and foreshadowings are going to be missed. If you do not know who Hawkeye is  for example  it may cause you to wonder why a government agent is jumping around and shooting off strange arrows.My biggest concern was: how do you make a movie about a team where the individuals have such strong personalities? Particularly the Hulk  who is not a team player. This was addressed.,positive

Basically Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson)  director of S.H.I.E.L.D.  is meeting some colleagues in a remote facility where the energy source the Tesseract has been found and activated  opening a gateway transporting the Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) from Asgard to Earth. He steals the powerful cube and takes over the minds of personnel like Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård)  and this forces Fury to reactivate the Avengers Initiative  recruiting some of the world's most powerful and special heroes  starting with Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). She goes to find Bruce Banner aka The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) who is hiding somewhere in India for his scientific knowledge of the Tesseract - no mention of ""The Other Guy""  while Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) approaches Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) who also has technological knowledge - and his powerful mechanical suit  and Fury also brings Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) up to date with the situation  and he is still trying to get used to the modern world. While Loki disappeared into the abyss he was approached by the alien race the Chitauri  led by The Other (Alexis Denisof)  and they came to an agreement that if they got the Tesseract they would help him take over the Earth. Suited up  Captain America and Iron Man travel to Germany where Loki is meant to be hiding and trying to ignite and stabilise the power of the cube  showing his evil intent to many people kneeling before him  he surrenders though when they fight and catch him. In this process though the villain's half-brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) arrives  also transported from Asgard  and he plans to take and deal with him in his own way  and this turns into a fight between him  Iron Man and Captain America  but it eventually stops. Loki is placed into a cell  designed to hold The Hulk inside if Banner turns  and now with Thor recruited as well the Avengers argue about how to handle the alien dictator  and there is the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plan to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons. Fury explains that he heard about what happened in Mexico  when Thor was previously on Earth  and that the attack makes Earth an easy target  and the weapons will be good defence for a similar attack  and as the argument continues Loki's mind controlled agents infiltrate the ship  the Helicarrier. Captain America and Iron Man try to start the engines again  while Thor tries fight against Banner who has become The Hulk and may destroy the ship from the inside  and fighting with Barton  Romanoff discovers a hard hit to the head will knock possessed people back to normal. In the struggle Loki kills Agent Coulson and escapes the ship  Banner as Hulk and Thor are ejected from the ship and fall to the ground  and Fury uses the death of Coulson to encourage the Avengers left to come together  work as a team and save the world. They know that the villain wants to become ruler as well as destroy cities  and using Dr. Selbig he has created a device to open the gateway and allow the Chitauri to invade and attack Manhattan  and it is up to Captain America  Iron Man  Black Widow  Hawkeye  Thor and The Hulk to save the day. In the end  after Dr. Selvig is revived  so much explosive fighting  and a prevented missile blowing up in space  Loki is taken back with the Tesseract by Thor to Asgard  the Avengers go their separate ways  until a new threat to the world emerges  and the final scene sees The Other meeting his master  who turns and reveals himself to be Thanos. Also starring Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill  Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts  Paul Bettany as Jarvis  Sudden Death's Powers Boothe as World Security Council  Jenny Agutter as World Security Council  Harry Dean Stanton as Security Guard  Lou Ferrigno as the voice of The Hulk and a cameo by Stan Lee. The cast are all fantastic  Downey Jr. with all the quips  Evans as the sensible fighter  Ruffalo as the man trying to control his temper  Hemsworth as the arrogant warrior  Johansson as the confident female  and Jackson as the intelligent controller. It should be noted that the title was changed in Britain from The Avengers because there would be confusion with the Honor Blackman/Dianna Rigg TV series  and also there were small complaints about Spider-Man and Wolverine absent  but it doesn't matter. Anyway  the story and scripting are very well made  and what steals the show is the brilliantly paced fight sequences filled with the most spectacular and ground breaking special effects to create all the superhero gadgets and gimmicks  invading creatures  and constant explosions  this is definitely one of the greatest superhero movies of the last few years  a must see action fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects  and it was nominated the BAFTA for Special Visual Effects. Very good!",positive

Using his powers he steals the Tesseract and takes control of scientist Dr Erik Selvig and SHIELD agent Clint Barton. He intends to give the Tesseract to The Other in exchange for an army to conquer Earth. First he will have to gain certain items to open a large enough portal for his army. Meanwhile SHIELD director Nick Fury assembles the world's superheroes to battle Loki. They aren't natural team players and are soon bickering and fighting amongst themselves. Loki is captured with surprising ease almost as if being captured was part of his plan.If you are a fan of the superhero genre then I'm sure this will be a must see; if like me you aren't exactly a fan of the genre but do enjoy the occasional superhero film then this is one that is worth watching. The fact that it includes several varied superheroes is rather fun. Having only seen the 'Iron Man' films and the old '70s Hulk TV series I wasn't familiar with most of them but that didn't really matter as it soon becomes apparent what powers each of them have and the reason for those powers isn't really important. There is lots of action throughout this is all pretty exciting and the technology they use looks great; I particularly liked the Helicarrier  a flying aircraft character reminiscent of the 'Cloud Base' in 'Captain Scarlet' only this one is introduced to us when it is in the water. Even on a fairly small scene the climactic scenes look good but would recommend watching on the largest screen you can to get the full effect. The cast does a fine job making their unbelievable characters believable. Overall I'd say this is a fine example of the genre that is suitable for all but younger children.,positive

And I had read up on the hype around this movie  so I might as well give it a go as well.And as a fairly non-superhero kind of guy  well I must say that ""The Avengers"" was one interesting and exciting ride of an action movie. The story was  for me at least  rather slow paced up to the point where the alien army came through the portal. Sure  it was building up character and getting the various characters introduced properly to those not having seen any of the prior movies.The effects in ""The Avengers"" were top notch  as to be expected from a movie of this caliber. Lots of really great effects and visuals. However  when that aircraft carrier ship started to transform and then fly  I was ready to turn off the movie. That was just silly. But I decided to keep watching and look past that one particular horrendous scene.However  one thing did make me wonder  with all the destruction in New York  you didn't see a single civilian getting hit or killed in any way  that was just stupid  especially with so many people living there. In fact  you only saw very few deaths throughout the entire movie  which was sort of lame.Another thing puzzled me  when Bruce Banner turned into The Hulk for the first time in the movie  he was out of control  smashing everything and everyone in sight. But somehow he magically overcame that and was fully in control the second time. That just seemed very implausible and sort of contradicted what we had just seen at the first transformation.And as with the previous Marvel movies with these characters  they had some great performances to the movie. I think that it was actually Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki who put on the most memorable performance in the movie and stood out the most.""The Avengers"" was good entertainment  even for an anti-superhero guy like myself. Great action. Lots of destruction. And great special effects.",positive

This trite set-up allows for countless effects filled battles during which no-one suffers anything more than a bruised ego.An impressive line-up of Hollywood A-listers and the most spectacular state-of-the-art CGI effects money can buy do not alter the fact that this is predictable  clichéd nonsense told with little style  coherence or originality.,positive

I re-watched the first 10 or so minutes after I had seen the whole movie  doing so helps put the whole story in perspective. The USA  NASA  and the World Council are all interested in the small cube of energy captured at one time  it allows a portal to a different part of the universe. When it gets a mind of its own in the lab  the mythical god Loki appears with a giant burst of energy  and right away we see he is up to no good. If he can position the energy cube outside  pointed to the sky  his legions will be able to enter and take over the Earth. The main star  in a movie filled with stars  is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and Iron Man. We also have Chris Evans as Steve Rogers and Captain America  Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and The Hulk  Chris Hemsworth as Thor  Loki's brother  Scarlett Johansson (my favorite) as Natasha Romanoff and Black Widow  and Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton and Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston is good and sinister as Loki.We eventually find out  after Tony Stark figures it out  that Loki's approach is to alienate each human superhero against the others  divide and conquer. Humans are eventually saved when the six superheros band together and each uses his and her special powers to defeat the aliens.Of course there is lots of action  much of it taking place on a very large aircraft carrier that can transform itself into a giant flying carrier. Then the final action is in Manhattan  with quite a bit of destruction. In the end it is Stark as Iron Man that diverts a missile with a nuclear warhead  steering it through the upper opening of the portal  destroying the mothership which was responsible for keeping the battle going.Other key characters were Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson  pretty Cobie Smulders dressed in a sleek black outfit as Agent Maria Hill  Stellan Skarsgård as the scientist Selvig  Samuel L.

Marvel's The Avengers  the culmination of the work of five movies (one of them a sequel to the first  Iron Man)  is stuffed with a good load of action and mayhem and a climax that bursts at the seams with aliens being torn apart by the heroes Captain America  Incredible Hulk  Thor and Tony Stark (plus relative newcomers Black Widow and Hawkeye  with Nick Fury and Agent Colson in the wings)  and if you want to get your money shots  Joss Whedon doesn't skimp out. But the reason why he was chosen as the filmmaker here wasn't just for name cachet (though it probably helped).What Whedon's done over much of his career in TV and other films and webseries (Buffy  Firefly  Dr. Horrible  Angel  etc) was excel at bringing groups of people together against fantastical  supernatural  other-worldly/alien forces  but making it always about stakes  humor  horror  drama and solid conflicts. Villains don't just act nasty  they have their own logic and reasons for doing what they do  and if they're not sympathetic they certainly are understandable as characters  full of the stuff that makes them great to watch  especially with the best dialog probably out of anyone (i.e. the Mayor on Buffy  for those that recall).So here we get Loki  previously a villain in Thor (and later sort of brought back for Thor 2)  and is by far the highlight of the film as Tom Hiddleston chews up scenery  but does it in a kind of elegant  theatrical  relishing way. By the time he spews out 'Muelling quim""  you're on the edge of your seat. His performance  what he does with every moment of screen time  is much more exciting than any alien snake going through the sky. And yet his ego and petty-mindedness does him in  and Whedon has a lot of fun writing this character  making him a threat but someone who can be taken down under the circumstances.This is one of the best of the Marvel films just by the way that Whedon goes about the sort of 'Ghostbusters/Ninja Turtles' formula - the four main players  each distinct  playing off one another  but things could turn on a dime any moment amid the jokes and this and that. Along with Hiddleston  Downey once again makes Tony Stark a helluva great character to take in as he is constantly thinking even as he is laying his sarcasm and deadpan on the other characters. And Johansson actually has a few really great scenes - Whedon has always written women characters as complex to the point that they put other ""complex"" male characters to shame - and somehow amid the many characters and plot turns going on  she stands out  especially Widow's scene with Loki. Ruffalo  too  does a lot with a little... until he gets to the ""other guy"".I don't know if Avengers is great art  but it does what I want to see when I go to big giant behemoth-like spectacles: provide me a host of characters who have to work together  and gives them interesting  entertaining and believable things to say. At 142 minutes it goes by at a great pace as well - not too fast  not too slow  nothing drags here  and that counts as well. Along with the first Iron Man and the recent Marvel Netflix show Daredevil  this is the MCU at the top of their game.",positive

Now that I've seen it  I feel a bit disappointed. Now I must admit that the film was terribly original and had some odd twists  though the film overall is awfully grim and lifeless--mostly because it was hard connecting with the characters.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play magicians who are partners. Things go very well for a while until Jackman's wife is accidentally killed doing a dangerous trick. Jackman blames Bale for this and you really can't tell if Bale did anything wrong or if it was just a sad tragedy. Regardless  Jackman spends the rest of the film persecuting Bale and trying to destroy him. After a while  Bale begins fighting back and it's an all-out war with horrible consequences. I won't say more--because I don't want to spoil the film. However  I will say that it gets really  really  really weird when Nicola Tesla (played very well by David Bowie) enters the fray--creating the ultimate magical box for Jackman.Aside from the magic box being ridiculously anachronistic  the film is so slow and hard to love--despite it's wonderful twists. It's hard to like either of the magicians (particularly Jackman) and after a while I lost interest--mostly because of the pacing and disagreeable characters. Overall  I greatly respect the film but also didn't particularly enjoy watching it.,negative

Even weaker efforts  where his ambition can get in the way  have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically  and often entertaining and thought-provoking  also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'The Prestige' is not quite perfect  but is still very good and one of Nolan's better films. To me actually it was close to outstanding  which makes my issues with the denouement even more frustrating. And it is the denouement that's 'The Prestige's' biggest problem  being over-baked and with one twist too many  the second of which being a convoluted cop-out and like the other twists before the denouement didn't happen.Was also  to a lesser extent  expecting more from David Julyan's music score  having done such a great job with the score for 'Memento'. His score for 'The Prestige' works within the film and has a mystical and dread quality  but it is not one of those scores that is listenable or even re-listenable as music on its own  lacking the cleverness and mood and thematic complexities of his work for 'Memento' and being somewhat too simplistic to be entirely memorable.However  'The Prestige' looks wonderful. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious  complete with gorgeously evocative Victorian period production and costume design. Once again  Nolan directs impeccably  not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling  while the script is smart  thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate  and while the film is long there is enough to keep one riveted.The story for 'The Prestige' is quite the fascinating tale  with an incredible period and darkly magical atmosphere and twists and turns peppered throughout but done in a way that the storytelling is coherent and taken with sincere seriousness while not coming across as emotionally cold.Fine acting all round  with a charmingly flamboyant Hugh Jackman and intensely charismatic Christian Bale perfectly cast and playing off against other wonderfully. Michael Caine brings class and dignity to his role  and seeing how he altered his voice and posture for it it was clear he was right in the zone. Rebecca Hall  Piper Perabo and Scarlett Johansson also do well  as does surprisingly David Bowie in an unlikely role. Andy Serkis is similarly memorable.Overall  imperfect film but also a fascinating one  flaws and all it is for me one of Nolan's better films. 8/10 Bethany Cox.,negative

Then what a shame it is that THE PRESTIGE turns out to be nothing more than a silly  muddled science fiction film masquerading as a serious and engaging drama.It starts off on a strong footing  with interesting characters and situations  but quickly loses these in a stupid plot that jumps all over the place and never bothers making much sense. The biggest kick in the teeth  however  is the ending  which ties things up with two plot twists that are frankly awful. The first is a sci-fi staple – cloning. What place does it have in a supposedly realistic Victorian thriller? It just turns this film into a fantasy and loses audience interest. The second twist is the one that's apparent early on  and one of the classic 'tricks' much beloved by writers of murder mysteries and crime thrillers. It's also been done to death and was outdated about a century ago  but no  it's resurrected here and had me groaning  feeling cheated when it appeared.THE PRESTIGE isn't a totally bad film and there are quite a few things to recommend it. It looks fantastic  and all of the electric special effects are tremendous. It also boasts a pretty good cast  with Christian Bale delivering another outlandish performance – his Cockney accent here is quite amusing – and Michael Caine presiding over things in his usual manner. Hugh Jackman I don't particularly like as an actor  and he's at best passable here; but in comparison to the hopeless Scarlett Johansson  who struggles with her British accent  he's Laurence Olivier! There are some fun minor roles for Andy Serkis and David Bowie  the latter playing the inventor Nikola Tesla and doing a good job of it. While the magic acts and tricks are engaging when they're on screen  it's just a shame that the film becomes so implausible and cops out towards the end. THE PRESTIGE contains nothing I'll want to sit through again.,negative

Due to hubris  Julia is killed in one of the tricks. It sets off a combative obsessive competition between Angier and Borden that ends in their eventual destruction. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson play other love interests.This is a dense complicated plot. If you figured it out before the ending  then you're much smarter than me. Christopher Nolan and his brother have woven an intrigue story of obsession and revenge. The twists will leave you stunned. The reveals of the tricks are jaw dropping. It doesn't get more mind bending than this one.In a way  the flashforwards are not that necessary. It throws a complicated story into more confusion. It's too much.

It takes a period before the advent of the illusionist pyrotechnics of modern times and shows us the magic. Not only does it have the magic working for it  it has a great story of revenge  hatred  one-upsmanship  genius  you name it. The story teaches us about illusion which is a much more accurate term for what we see. I will never look at David Copperfield the same way again. There is incredible scenic effluence. The acting is impeccable and the direction and cinematography is unrivaled. For once a film that lives up to its hype. Using David Bowie as Tesla is marvelous. I've always thought that he should have had a much greater career as an actor than he has realized. Michael Caine is the voice of reason  but his voice is seldom listened to. Revenge is one of the oldest motives and it poisons one of the characters. Stay with this one; then see it again. It is a masterpiece.,positive

Instead  it became one of the finest films of the year 2006. ""The Prestige"" is a perfect example of what a movie should be like if it does not rely on you liking and cheering for the central characters. Neither Angier (Jackman)  nor Borden (Bale) are likable characters at all. And yet you are completely under their spell as this film goes on. This may be a bit of a subjective take as I quite like Hugh Jackman and find Bale a joy to watch most of the time as well. And Johansson and Hall are among my favorite actresses as well. But it's not only the cast that makes it so much worth watching. It's also the visual side. Art direction  set decoration  cinematography and costumes are top-notch and even the rare special effects are pretty nice. The film managed two Academy Award nominations for its visual side  both of them very deserved and I actually would not have minded if it had won one of these over ""Pan's Labyrinth"".The film's director is Christopher Nolan and he also wrote the movie together with his brother after the first Batman film. He also cast some of the actors from his superhero trilogy  including Bale and Caine  the only one who didn't do that much for me. Now back to Nolan's script: I think this is probably the heart and soul of the film. Such love to detail  so much suspense  so many surprises and all these great scenes like the doppelgänger parts or the suicide of Hall's character in the room with all the birds  which were actually the way how he met her when he talked to her nephew. Very very smart screenplay. All in all  the best thing about it  however  is how he wrote the two protagonists and their egos constantly clashing with each other  maybe because they weren't so different after all. Of course  Jackman and Bale give great performances too and that is why it worked so well  but still you cannot appreciate Nolan's effort enough. And his brother's. Lets not forget about him. People say  Nolan has problems when it comes to directing and writing realistic female characters  but I disagree. He managed in this film without a doubt and he also managed in others. When the two magicians fight each other or I should probably say get their hands dirty  literally everybody else in this film is constantly affected: their women  their assistants  their set creators...The accidental death of one character's wife sets off a deadly spiral which results in murder in the end. Or does it really? Nothing in this film is what it seems and we do not only get one major plot twist in the end  but two. Apart from that  the progress in terms of inventions and electricity also brings a completely new dimension of progress for the profession of a magician  actually for life in general  for everybody. So  we also get some interesting references on Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. I also liked how Nolan revealed some tricks  but not all of them  so the movie itself stays a bit of a mystery still. This was the second time I watched this film and it was as good as the first. I highly recommend watching the almost 10-year-old  120 minute-long ""The Prestige"". It's possibly my favorite Christopher Nolan movie.",positive

I want people to think good of me and perhaps respect me; I don't think it is an unnatural thing and  no matter what they say  most people feel the same. However I have never pandered in my opinion to the majority voice and the IMDb's ridiculous ""was this comment useful"" voting system will not deter me from questioning why this film is so highly thought of. On one level I can see why because it is a masterful piece of story-telling that weaves flashbacks within flashbacks as easily as moving between concurrent scenes set in the present (whenever that is in regards the narrative). In doing this it doesn't produce confusion as to when we are but rather makes the story much stronger and deeper. Nor did I have a problem with the sci-fi ideas being put into Victoria times; no  although the ""cloning"" machine is a jump  it is only a jump because my head is stuck in the period and not accepting such an idea as I would in another film.No  the problem I had with it was the build up to an ending that I had to spend a lot of time thinking about. I didn't think so much because I didn't get it  I thought about it because I didn't think it would be so straightforward (in sci-fi terms of course) and predictable. The boards are full of debate over whether the machine works or not  but I think that the reason for this is that many are keen to find a twist and trick that isn't really there. This was a letdown for me and the delivery of the final scenes suggested that I should be taking it as a twist or surprise  but really it isn't. To me this stops it being as good as everyone else seems to think it is  but I still can see the strengths that kept it interesting for two hours.As said the story-telling is very strong  even if the conclusion isn't all I would have liked. Visual themes (clues?) are run throughout the film in a way that isn't clear until after the plot becomes clear. Ahead of this stuff though  is an engaging story in regards the characters  which was what drove the majority of the film for me. The flashback structure compliments the narrative well and produces characters sucked under by envy  hate  bitterness. With this to work with both Jackman and Bale give strong performances that really drew the script out and made this aspect so interesting to me. Caine is a class-act as he often can be but some of the other casting is questionable. Serkis I have no problem with in a minor role  but Bowie is always a risky prospect (see Fire Walk With Me for proof  or rather lack of proof since he was cut down to a minimum to the detriment of the film). Here he isn't terrible but he certainly isn't any good. Johansson I'm not sure about as an actress. She is pretty as a young woman but her acting isn't always up to scratch and here she is pretty average at best.Overall then  not as brilliant as everyone would have you believe because the conclusion is nowhere near as strong (or surprising) as the delivery and build-up within the film would suggest (far less the gushing praise and theorising herein). The manner of telling is masterful though and works so well that perhaps it accounts for my problems late in the game. The lead pair respond well to this  both turning in very strong performances. A very good film then  just not as wonderful and flawless as the praise on this site would have you believe.",positive

The great production design  the fabulous acting  the great cinematography  the superb writing  the awesome directing ... I really don't know. But I do know  that this is another Nolan movie. Which kinda is a trademark or became one for me. That is why the number one movie I was looking forward in 2010  was ""Inception"".But I will get into that other movie on its own page. If you haven't watched any Christopher Nolan movie yet ... well it's almost not possible. Even if you got away from all the buzz Memento created  it's almost impossible  that you haven't seen at least one of the Batman movies he made. Then again you might not be into that sort of movies. And that's the great thing about Nolan. Making entertaining movies  that have substance.Maybe Insomnia is his ""weakest"" movie (if you count the reception it got) and ""Following"" was just a student film  but even those two are a showcase of his talent. But then again  I might be just a fan-boy drooling about achievements that you think are not worthy mentioning. You have to make up your own mind ... start with this mind-boggling or with any other of his movies ... Repeated viewing is almost necessary! And you will most likely want to anyway!",positive

Until then it was a compelling and complex tale dealing in murder  mystery and intrigue with a clever backdrop of magicians attempting to outdo each other with the grandest illusion of all time. What I'm not going to do is go back and watch this three times in a row like I did with ""Memento"" because when all is said and done  I won't be any better off. In a way I felt cheated that an 1880's era film would bring in a fictional sci-fi element the way it did. It seems to me the story could have gotten around that contrivance to come up with a more realistic resolution that confined itself to existing science and techniques of illusion. Then  when Borden (Christian Bale) had his final showdown with Angier (Hugh Jackman)  he could have caught the bullet to end the picture on a more promising note. I don't really mean to sound so harsh on the film because like I said  up to the Tesla part this story was going great guns. Maybe because the guy portraying Tesla looked so much like David Bowie  it kept me off stride for a while as well. Then it turned out to be Bowie when the credits rolled  and I was back to thinking about that business with the cats and the hats. Maybe the whole thing was an illusion.",positive

It tells the story of magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Initially partners  they had a falling out and became rivals. From there the movie becomes a battle of wits  showing how the men have no aim except to destroy the other. Caine plays John Cutter  the state engineer who works for Angier.I notice similarities between this movie and some of Nolan's others. There's the non-linear plot  like ""Memento""; one-upmanship  like ""Insomnia""; the question of morality  like in ""The Dark Knight"". But what impressed me more than anything was all the stuff about magic tricks  how the characters use the tricks against each other  and how they both use Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). Angier's and Borden's rivalry mirrors Nikola Tesla's (David Bowie) rivalry with Thomas Edison.All in all  I recommend this movie. It's both a look into the world of magic tricks  and also the dangers of obsession with revenge. Also starring Andy Serkis (Gollum in the LOTR movies) and Ricky Jay (a real-life magician).PS: other 2006 movies dealing with magic tricks are ""The Illusionist"" and ""Scoop"" (also starring Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson).",positive

An hour later  I thought it was pretty clever. And now  the next day  I think it was amazing. Why the change? It took that long for most or all of the subtle hints to sink in and the real twists to be discovered. The film doesn't end when you leave  it begins.The story is the tale of two magicians in a bitter rivalry  always trying to do a better trick than the other and trying to sabotage the other's success. At least  that's what you think the story is until you finally see ""the prestige"".I can't discuss much of this film because giving almost anything at all away would ruin some of the fun. But a few notes: Christian Bale  as always is awesome. An incredible actor with a wide range and screen appeal. Christopher Nolan works well with him (see ""Batman Begins"") and I hope they continue this Burton-Depp relationship they have. I foresee only greatness.Hugh Jackman is also spectacular  probably giving the most diverse performance in the film  easily the most demanding. And he does this convincingly.Scarlett Johannson is Scarlett Johannson... if you've liked her before  you should like her here (though her role never really gets the full story it needs). And David Bowie... wow  he is so much better than ""Labrynth"" would have you believe.The visuals are stunning  but the real credit goes to the makeup department  who deserve an Oscar for this picture. Outside of horror films where extensive makeup is often required  this film probably does more to change the actors' appearances than any other film I've ever seen.

Basically  in 19th Century London  famous magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is on trial for the suspected murder of rival magician Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman)  and through flashback we see how their story played out all the way to the trial. So Alfred and Robert were originally good friends working as magician assistants for performer Milton (Ricky Jay)  and their engineer for all the tricks and illusions on stage was Cutter (Sir Michael Caine). Their friendship turns into strong rivalry between each other when Robert's wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo) is put in the glass box of water to perform the famous escape trick  but Alfred supposedly tied a different knot for her to untie  therefore Robert blames him for her death from drowning. Separately they both become magician performers with their own stage show acts  Borden calls himself The Professor  while Angier becomes The Great Danton  and trying to ruin each other's performance  and maybe get new ideas for astonishing acts  they both disguise themselves once or twice to do just this. Robert has a new wife Sarah (Rebecca Hall) who gives him a daughter  and he has Cutter and his new assistant Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson)  but he is looking for a new and revolutionary illusion. In disguise he attends the performance of his Rival  and he astonishes the audience with his new act  The Transported Man  and he wants to try and recreate the act  i.e. steal it  for himself  so Cutter finds him a very convincing lookalike to achieve this. But Robert wants to find out the real way to do the trick  or better create his own extraordinary alternative to it  and he finds that with some new technological marvel for real transportation  almost like teleportation. When he has perfected the act  and he knows Albert will be disguised in the audience and watching  that is when he lures him backstage to witness him fall through the trap door for the trick  and drown in the below water tank. That is how Albert is caught and imprisoned for the ""murder""  however he is shocked when he finds out that Robert is still alive  in disguise  and that he framed him. The film mentions the three important magic trick components: 1) the setup - show the something ordinary  2) the performance  make something change  and 3) the prestige  bring the something back. The final shock of the film is not Robert being alive  but being killed by Albert  and the revelation that he has an identical twin brother  and that the real man is not the one in prison  oh  and that's how The Transported Man worked. Also starring Samantha Mahurin as Jess Borden  David Bowie as Tesla  Andy Serkis as Alley  Daniel Davis as Judge and Roger Rees as Owens. Jackman and Bale are equally matched as the mentally duelling magicians  Caine is really good as the man in amongst it all  Johansson gets her moments too  and the direction by Nolan is perfectly timed. The special effects for the magic is really good  the tricks themselves look as though they could be done for real  and the story is engaging  as for whether this is better than The Illusionist  it is  a terrific period mystery thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography. Very good!",positive

After a brief introduction we see Angier drown as a trick appears to have been sabotaged by Borden and the latter in put on trial for his murder but are things what they seem? The story then unfolds from the time they were friends to the final revelation concerning what really happened in that opening scene.Angier and Borden's friendship is irrevocably broken when Angier's wife is killed when a trick goes wrong; Angier is convinced that it was Borden's fault. The two go their own ways and put on rival magic shows. Angier sees a chance for revenge when Borden attempts the famous 'bullet catch' trick; he hides himself amongst the crowd then volunteers to be the man who pulls the trigger  slips a real bullet into the gun and pulls the trigger; Borden survives but loses two fingers. Time passes and Borden develops a new trick; 'The Transporting Man'. This seemingly impossible trick sees Borden enter one cupboard then emerge from another almost instantly. Angier is desperate to replicate the trick but can't figure out how it is done. His ingénieur (trick creator)  Cutter  is certain that it must involve a double but Angier is certain that the only man on stage is Borden. He performs his own version  using a double but is unsatisfied; determined to learn the truth he sends his stage assistant  Olivia Wenscombe  to pretend to work for Borden to learn the secret; she steals his notebook but it is encrypted. Angier forces Borden to tell him the key word (Tesla) and this leads him to search out scientist Nikola Tesla in Colorado to get the equipment he needs this ultimately works but not in a way anybody would expect.Anybody familiar with the films of director Christopher Nolan will know to expect the unexpected and shouldn't be put off by the non-linear narrative it isn't just that the story is told in flashback; instead it moves back and forward revealing aspects of the story. This isn't just a gimmick as it works to make things interesting. The way the two magicians' rivalry escalates perfectly encapsulates their obsessions; not just to be the best but also to destroy the other. The cast does a fine job; most notably Hugh Jackman  Christian Bale and Michael Caine who play Angier  Borden and Cutter respectively. They are ably supported by Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson as Borden's wife Sarah and Olivia Wenscombe  there is also an enjoyable cameo from the late David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. The final resolution is rather surprising; largely because it is blatant science-fiction rather than a magic trick this might disappoint some viewers although others will enjoy the dark twist when they realise the secret behind Angier's version of 'The Transporting Man'. Overall I'd certainly recommend this impressive and intriguing film.,positive

One of the young men  Borden (Christian Bale) may have been responsible for the death of the other's beloved blond wife  the other being Angier (Hugh Jackman). Angier and his mentor  Michael Caine  continue their careers  while Borden builds his own.The emotional tumult caused by the death of Angier's wife leads him to sabotage Borden's performance  actually shooting two of his fingers off. Borden  filled with resentment  retaliates by putting a major crimp into Angier's career. It gets a little complicated but they both wind up more or less at the top of the prestidigitative heap before the end.There are romances flung into the pot too  functional to the extent that they illustrate character development in the two magicians and act as links between the two competitors. Scarlette Johansson is surprisingly good as the bosomy stage assistant with the working-class Brit accent  even though the dialect suppresses her usual croak. Rebecca Hall is splendid as the perceptive woman who takes up with the lower-class Borden  even though she knows he's lying half the time when he tells her he loves her. (He's married to his job  you see.) Enter Nicolas Tesla  the very real historical figure who did all sorts of things  conceptual and physical  that strike some of us as a little outré today. A man ahead of his time  played by an unrecognizable David Bowie.At this point  what was a more or less cogent drama turns into something else. Tesla  like Baron Frankenstein  pulls off something that's half scientific and half supernatural. If you've seen ""The Fly"" you have some idea  only the idea you have is a little simpler than the one presented here. I was a little confused by the ending in which ""all is explained"" but somewhat too perfunctorily for me. Maybe I'm dull but the jigsaw puzzle remained mostly a table full of scattered and disjointed pieces.The photography captures the time and place nicely. Too nicely  maybe  because it's hard to imagine anyone wanting to live in a landscape of perpetual poverty and gloom. If there was a scene in bright daylight  I missed it. Do we learn anything about the tricks of stage magicians? Are you kidding? Illusionists have the kinds of social borders (us inside  them outside) that cops have  or airline pilots or doctors. The trick is told when the trick is sold. We do see some of the machinations but they're ones we might have easily figured out for ourselves. The ultimate trick  the one devised by Tesla  is of course never explained because it never happened.I hope you don't find these comments confusing. If you do  the film will present an even greater challenge. Still  it's worth watching for anyone with mature sensibilities. Confusing  maybe. Pandering  no.",positive

Using rather obvious ploys (like phony beards and wigs  not to mention Scarlett Johansson as an assistant/secret agent)  they each work as much on sabotaging the other's latest success as developing their own skills. This fantastic tale  directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan from the novel by Christopher Priest  might have bowled us over with a few cunning twists; unfortunately  the baffling screenplay reminds one more of H. G. Wells than ""Sleuth""  coming up with a bag of tricks so far-fetched it removes the film's core of inherent reality. The film is remarkably well-dressed and crafted  although the jumpy editing at the start (darting around in time before settling into a more conventional mode of storytelling) is rather a nuisance.

The Prestige.,15-Mar-07,"""The third stage is sometimes called the effect  or the prestige  and this is the product of magic."" (Christopher Priest) That is the derivation of the movie's title. The whole plot involves two magicians who are competing ever since they were magician helpers together. Their jealousy and desire to learn of each others' best magic tricks provide the tension in the story.Hugh Jackman is Robert Angier  eventually the lesser of the two  and who spends much of the movie time trying to avenge a death. Christian Bale as Alfred (Freddy) Borden is the better of the two  always seeming to one-up Angier. Michael Caine is Cutter who designs the illusions and equipment  and is ready backstage with an ax in case the escape from the water tank is not made on time.Scarlett Johansson (with British accent) as Olivia Wenscombe becomes the 4th member of the circle. She at first assists Angier  but he sends her to get a job with Borden  to learn the secret to his ""transported man"" trick.An interesting casting is David Bowie as Nikola Tesla  a real historical scientist who experimented with electricity. Many recognize his name for the ""Tesla coil."" I didn't recognize Bowie during the movie.We found it a very interesting 2 hours. All the cast members are good and the twists and turns held our attention.SPOILERS. Early when Angier and Borden are working together  and Angier's young wife is part of the act  she drowns after being dropped into the water tank because she cannot get out of the wrist knot that Borden tied  and thus could not reach around and unlock the trick lock. Angier never forgives Borden  and much later a trial found Borden guilty of killing someone else and sentenced to a hanging. Eventually Angier develops a transported man illusion  using a very close double they find  on one side of the stage Angier opens a door to conceal his dropping below the stage  while behind the door on the other side of the stage the double surfaces from beneath. Trouble with the double (doubt planted by Borden in a pub) cut that act short. Meanwhile Borden was doing his amazing trick and only at the end  while Angier is dying  do we learn that there were 2 Bordens  identical twins. One was loyal to his wife  the other was in love with Olivia. There was no cheating.Within that story  was a highly fictional one where Angier paid Tesla to develop an electrical device which ""transported"" him by actually creating an exact double of himself  which of course he had to drown each performance to hide the fact. He framed Borden with one of those drownings.",positive

In my own case I had to go back and re-watch the ending. This isn't a movie you can watch and zone out - the plot requires active following  as Nolan switches points of view between Angier and Borden  and skips from the past to the present. However  he does it with a master's skill. The other interesting thing about the film is the bad guy/good guy concept  which he turns upside down and inside out.""The Prestige"" captures the atmosphere of 19th century London perfectly. All of the actors - and the casting is superb - are in top form  with Caine giving an steady performance as the old magician who tries to keep Angier grounded and David Bowie as the mysterious Nikola Tesla.

Co-writer/director Christopher Nolan is very much in his territory here with this picture  and the sort of jigsaw-figure-out effect he had on his breakthrough Memento is redeployed here in a style that is never too deterring. He focuses so well on the two main characters  and the people focused around them  that there's no need to really feel as if one is being pulled away from the real emotional drive of each character. It's basically one big game that becomes something very dangerous once obsession becomes part of it (as Michael Caine's character notes is what children do). But all the while I went along totally well with what the story went through  in all its twists and pulling seemingly simple little turns out of a hat  because Nolan made the storytelling seamless and has actors that are utterly dependable and pitch-perfect in their roles.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play the magicians  who start out as partners under the tutelage of Michael Caine's Cutter  who perform acts of not-totally-simple 'magic'  which follow three main principles which are listed by Cutter at the start and end of the picture. After a tragedy that befalls their assistant (Piper Perablo)  the rivalry and  more crucially  the aims and wills of each side is put into play. On one side is Bale's Borden  who is  according to Jackman's Angier  living his entire life as a trick  which may not be far from the truth (hope that doesn't spoil things). On the other is Angier  who becomes involved with the burgeoning technology of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie  who is one of the lesser factors of actors in the film)  who may be able to figure out how to make something truly unbelievable. Their fates become entangled in each side's pursuit to out-do the other in the public eye  with Cutter and the change-around mistress (Scarlet Johanssen  in a spiffy English accent that works)  on the sidelines.What makes a lot of this more compelling that it almost has a right to be is how much we're steeped into the mind-sets of these characters  who they get fractured by their own separate ambitions amid their skills. One is a better magician  while the other is a better showman  and each can't stand the other's talents in the midst of being somewhat intrigued and drawn to a kind of madness. And yet at the same time the personal also finds its way into the trickery of the film  and actually grounds things- seemingly of course- particularly with Borden's wife (Rebecca Hall  one of the best in the film acting-wise) who feels betrayed by the pack of lies and secrecy. The fates then of both characters becomes that of dealing with mortality  and how one can cheat death or not  or again  and again. Towards the end it does teeter much on becoming one extra ending that might not be needed  or a couple of minutes that feel packed in too tight.But all the while Jackman and Bale are constantly compelling  with little things they have in their characters that make them very much real for us  and then makes the final twist not too unworthy of what led up to it. It's like a twist mountain  or rather  a prestige. It might not be the best kind of 'prestige' I've seen  yet I still highly recommend it as a cool treat of splendid storytelling in a story that teeters on leaving the audience with too much of a gasp in the extraordinary  and has just enough to pull back and have a few good surprises.

Now Hugh Jackman  Christian Bale  and Michael Caine were fine as were Scarlett Johansson  Piper Perabo  and David Bowie in a small role. Maybe if I were to watch again with a more alert eye I'd give this one a better rating but for now I'm giving this one a 5.,positive

Unquestionably these magicians are good artists  as they have to disguise a presumably very simple and logical trick and build a whole show around it  but at the same time the whole concept quickly tends to get boring. Just because you automatically presume there's a simple explanation for every illusion  you risk losing interest and I was more or less worrying that the movie would suffer from this exact same problem. It isn't very interesting to hear Michael Caine enlightening us about the different phases of a successful trick and it's even less interesting to constantly hear about two beginning magicians wanting to become the biggest performers of their time. Personally  I wasn't really hoping for a thriller revealing a lot of magic-secrets. I was merely anticipating a dark & sinister post-Gothic portrait revolving personal vendettas and macabre set pieces. And for the largest part  The Prestige actually delivers! The man in the director's chair is Christopher Nolan  and both ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia"" already proved he's a terrific storyteller  as he has the talent to bring an ordinary tale much more complex than it actually is. Nolan once again uses as irregular narrative structure  with jumps back and forward into time and well-camouflaged hints that eventually all lead to a gigantically grotesque denouement. Robert Angier (Hugh ""Wolverine"" Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian ""Batman Begins"" Bale) are two gifted pupils of the already legendary 'engineer' Cutter (Michael Caine)  both treasuring the ambition to become the nation's biggest magician. A regretful accident  resulting in Angier's wife tragic death on stage  causes their friendship to turn into intense competition and pretty soon they spend even more time sabotaging each other's shows than actually building up their own acts. When Alfred Borden eventually presents his perplexing Transported Man trick and Angier can't possibly decipher the logic behind it  the rivalry turns into a dangerous obsession that will require large sacrifices. The main attraction of this film is probably meant to be the guessing along for the tricks and the detailed exposition of a handful of basic magical acts  but honestly that whole aspect impressed me the least. With just a tad bit of concentration and the experience of having seen similar mystery-thrillers  the red herrings are fairly transparent. Also  the whole set-up of Robert Angiers ultimate act (with the help of pop star David Bowie in a remarkable role) is simply impossible to take serious. Whatever remains  however  is definitely worth watching. The mysterious late 19th Century set pieces are intriguing  especially the transporting machinery which seems to be inspired by the ""telepods"" in David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"". The detailed illustration of magical tricks didn't really fascinate me  although there's one notable exception: the disappearing canary! It's a cruel and pretty offensive old-school trick  but hilarious in case you have a weird sense of humor. Quite embarrassing  because I was the ONLY person in a sold-out theater who was laughing with this sequence. The acting performances are top-notch  but with an ensemble cast like this we wouldn't accept it any other way. Particularly Christian Bale is terrific  since his naturally mysterious charisma is ideal for a role as a magician. Scarlett Johansson's part is rather small  but her beautiful appearance helps cheering up the dark sets a lot.",positive

While having a typical 80s feel to it  which I like  I love how fun  irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious  the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level  the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film  or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good  and the cinematography  scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting  Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly  the role that propelled him to stardom  and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall  brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox,positive

Whichever way you look at it  BACK TO THE FUTURE is one of the most intelligent of the Hollywood blockbusters from that era  a film which perfectly merges crowd-pleasing entertainment with a complex and well-written storyline that gets to grips with the thorny subject of time travel.The underrated Michael J. Fox stars in the role of his life as Marty McFly  a guy who unwisely gets involved in time travel thanks to the machinations of his kooky inventor buddy  Doc Brown. Christopher Lloyd essays this subsidiary character and  again  it's the role of his life; he's over the top in it but nonetheless his character is thoroughly endearing and never less than hilarious.The time travel aspects of the storyline are carefully worked out and hold together very well even today  some 30 years after release. What I particularly liked about this film is the calibre of the writing: there's no slow spots or simplicity here  just one suspenseful sub-plot after another. There are small moments  big set-pieces  cutting edge special effects  action  chase scenes  romance  and of course plenty of humour  and a quirky supporting cast who make the most of their roles. BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic - and for good reason.,positive

It is sad what happened to him  but can there be a more impressive example of a person who has overcome the tribulations that life has given him. Whenever I see him in ""The Good Wife"" as the slimy  underhanded character lawyer he plays  I love that I can ""not like"" a man who is dealing with devastating Parkinson's. As the principle character in this movie  Marty is shoved from one situation to another in a time he only can guess at. He has to face the youth of his father  a febrile wimp who gets pushed around. Then  of course  there is the wonderful Christopher Lloyd as the professor. While one could never accuse this film of being true science fiction with all the implications of time travel  there is a kind of suspense that works very well.

However when Doc asks Marty to meet him late one night in a mall parking lot  he learns that Doc has invented a working time travel system and inserted it into a DeLorean. Much to Doc's joy and Marty's surprise the machine works on its test run and Doc is all set to be the first man to travel in time when he is killed by the terrorist group who stole plutonium for him with the impression he was making them a bomb. Marty flees in the DeLorean but accidentally winds up back in 1955. Back there he convinces Doc to help him out and come up with a way of getting him back to the future. However the problem of no plutonium appears small when Marty changes the past and stops his parents meeting and falling in love.In its own way this is a classic film that delivers the goods in the same way as Frank Capra's films does although I can understand why for some it doesn't hold quite the same appeal. The plot seems complex as it involves time travel and such but it is deceptively simple and is a clever mix of sci-fi and romantic comedy that is as light and enjoyable as you could hope for. It never makes fun of itself but it never takes itself too seriously and by doing this it pitches it just perfectly. The narrative may be light but it is consistently engaging whether it is the time travel aspect or the relationships. It isn't perfect and it isn't the deepest of films but it is effortlessly a lot of fun and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.The cast are roundly great and are a big part of the film being as light and fun as it is. For my money this is Fox's best all-round performance and he plays the clean-cut American teenager really well bringing energy to the character. Of course Lloyd's performance dominates the film by its sheer colour and energy  making him the most memorable character of the piece. Thompson and Glover (two people who still look young twenty years later damn them) are both good in their roles and work well together and individually to make their part of the narrative match up to the (superficially) more appealing sci-fi stuff. Zemeckis directs with an eye for a memorable shot and visually his film matches the style and vitality of the narrative.Overall a very good film that is every bit as pleasing as the Frank Capra feel-good films that are held up as classics. Whether this film is a classic is as much up for debate as those films' classic status but it isn't really a debate that means a lot to me. What matters is that the film is engaging and entertaining  which it consistently is. It glides through a slick plot and I always enjoy it when I revisit it. Well worth taking a look if you are after a great piece of family fun.,positive

Any self respecting movie fan should know the names  the actors and the movies that made them famous. Which in case of McFly and the series in general ... could have gone in a completely different direction - literally.Eric Stoltz got cast because the filmmaker could not get Michael J. Fox - had other contractual obligations. This is very well known. That his movie girlfriend was recast too  because the original one wasn't available at first - that I did not know. But it's all there and so much more in the Special features on the discs. Just the beginning of the movie is quite interesting and intriguing  because especially back then  no one knew what this was about. Well apart from the title of course.Very funny movie that sets off something in the careers of everyone involved. Yes the time travel aspect has flaws if you try to apply logic and consequences of certain actions and how they will spin out and what they will do - a ripple effect that is not entirely seen .. which would have been too complicated anyway.So sit back  relax and enjoy a very entertaining and funny movie,positive

The issue I have is with the IMDb ratings system that ranks this picture in the number #48 spot as I write this  with ""Citizen Kane"" at #45 and ""Vertigo"" at #51. For me  this doesn't compute. No one can justify to me how this comedy  sci-fi flick gets honored as one of the Top Fifty movies of all time.Well hopefully  my minor little rant doesn't spoil things for you. I do like the film for it's players and the clever way Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) manages to navigate his way through the Fifties. I became a Christopher Lloyd fan right from the get-go when he made his debut in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""  and his Reverend Jim character in the 'Taxi' TV series was one of the most original ever. He's got the perfect look and attitude for a crazed scientist and it would have been cool to see him work with classic icons of the horror genre like Karloff  Lugosi and Chaney. That would have been something.The thing that bugs me about the characters a bit are the way George McFly (Crispin Glover) and Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) are portrayed. They're really more like caricatures  though Biff as the town bully had a certain amount of credibility even if he was annoying. I had forgotten how attractive Lea Thompson was as Lorraine Baines  Marty's future Mom but sporting a major crush on him that conjured up all kinds of potential icky situations  but they were handled tastefully for the most part. The biggest kick for me was when Marvin Berry (Harry Waters Jr.) called his cousin Chuck to check out the new music sensation.So yeah  this is a fun movie and a generally family friendly one that would have been better served if some of the language had been toned down a bit. Some of the time travel stuff goes over the top  like the scene where Marty returns from 1955 and sees himself in the present about to do the time jump. Stuff like that just makes me think about the concept too much. As for the very ending scene  that has got to be about the most blatant set up to scream 'sequel' that I've ever seen.",negative

I sometimes have to wonder what would happen if I accidentally went back in time and met my parents. Given what happens in this movie  it's probably best that I stay in my own time.Anyway  it's an interesting contrast/comparison between the '50s and '80s.

Basically Marty McFly (Golden Globe nominated Michael J. Fox) is the young aspiring teenage musician and friend of Dr. 'Doc' Emmet Brown (a fantastic Christopher Lloyd)  and finds out that Doc has invented a time machine with a DeLorean car. It is run by tremendous power from plutonium  which he took from the Libyans  who find him and shoot him. When Marty escapes from them in the car and excels to 88mph (the speed needed to time travel) he is transported unintentionally to 1955 (which Doc set). Unfortunately  while looking for Doc to help him get home  he interferes with the history of his parents in this past  where they meet and fall in love  making his mother love him! Marty now not only has to get his parents  George (Crispin Glover  who did not return for the sequels) and Lorraine (Les Thompson) to fall in love again to restore history/the future  before he and his brother and sister are erased from existence  but the only power available instead of plutonium to get him back to the future (1985) is a bolt of lighting that will hit the clock tower (they know this from a paper he brought from 1985). A fantastic look at how time is so precious  and what can change from the tiniest history interference  aka time paradox. By the way  the plutonium was changed to trash in the end to help explain the sequels. Also starring Thomas F.

I'm sure people will be enjoying it for decades to come.Michael J. Fox will almost certainly be best remembered for his role as Marty McFly  the eighties teenager who accidentally travels back to 1955 in a converted DeLorean. While much of the humour is derived from the differences between the two eras that isn't over done and it doesn't get in the way of the main plot. Not only must Marty enlist the help of his friend Dr. Brown to get him back to 1985 he must get his parents to fall in love all over again because he accidentally stopped their first meeting. This problem seems to be greater than time travel as his father is the school wimp who is constantly being harassed by the school bully Biff Tannen and his mother has fallen for him.The supporting cast do a great job too  especially Christopher Lloyd is the archetypal mad scientist Dr Brown and Lea Thompson as Marty's mother who is rather prudish in the eighties but clearly knew how to have a good time when she was a teenager.. much to Marty's surprise. In a time before everything was done with CGI the effects are great and not overused. I'd recommend this film  along with its two sequels to anybody with a sense of humour.,positive

Homeless bums sleep on the benches of the town square. Fox's mother (Lea Thompson) is an overweight  hopeless alcoholic; his father is a witless nobody constantly abused by a burly friend who exploits him and then insults him for his imperfect efforts.Lloyd is a maniacal scientist who steals plutonium from Lebanese terrorists to fuel his traveling time machine.

No suburbs  but farmland ""as far as the eye can see."" A couple of good gags follow  right out of ""The Twilight Zone."" Pull into a gas station and half a dozen employees rush out to service your car. A cup of coffee is five cents. When Fox orders a Tab in the diner  the counter man doesn't know what he's talking about. A ""Pepsi free"" doesn't help.But there are of course the kind of complications that usually follow from time travel. Fox meets his own mother and father  as well as Dr. Brown. The problem is that Fox's mother gets the hots for him and Fox must arrange for his own father to take his place in her affection. In brief  he does so  successfully travels back to 1985  and finds Dr. Brown has paid attention to a warning and worn a bullet-proof vest so he survives the terrorist shooting.I enjoy seeing it once in a while and I gather it was immensely popular. There's just enough profanity to pep things up and keep this from being a movie for children. The plot itself isn't challenging in any way  though some of the gags require a certain maturity to be understood. Someone asks who is president in 1985. ""Ronald Regan? The actor? Who's vice president -- Jerry Lewis?"" Fox is a convincing high-schooler and easy to identify with. Christopher Lloyd is overly manic and with his bulging eyes resembles a creature out of the very depths of the ocean. Lea Thompson doesn't add much  but Chrispin Glover as Fox's father seems all flapping arms and legs.I think it might have been more enjoyable if the anachronisms had been spread throughout the movie instead of being all crowded into the first ten minutes or so of the 1955 period. Some of the comedy was thrown away in the interests of special-effects and pseudo-drama. (Think of ""Groundhog Day "" in which all the elements are seamlessly blended.) And it also appears that McFly adapts too readily to 1955. After the first few minutes  nothing surprises him. He takes this extraordinary experience for granted and simply goes about the business of bringing his parents together and figuring out a way to get back to his real ""present"" before his picture disappears from the snapshot he's brought along with him. (?) I'd have been taking notes every minute. A few liberties are also taken with the norms of 1955. Good girls  like Lea Thompson  didn't reach under the table to squeeze a stranger's thigh. At least none of them did that with me. And if theywouldn't have done it with me  they obviously wouldn't have done it to anyone. Except -- and this is probably the answer -- Lea Thompson was a slut to begin with. Yes  that must be it. How disgusting.Anyway  you'll have fun watching the film. The kids will too. It generated three sequels  none of which I've watched.",positive

Then  after an absence of time  I saw it again in the late '90s and was shocked to hear 11 blasphemes - a ridiculous amount for a comedy (and ""PG-rated "" to boot).Also  the character ""Biff"" (Thomas Wilson) was so irritating to me (he must have done a good job acting) it also fun out of viewing. I could say the same about ""Marty's"" father (Crispin Glover)  who was a disgusting wuss.

Strap in for some entertaining time travel...,27-Mar-19,"The 1985 movie ""Back to the Future"" is definitely a timeless - pardon the pun - classic. It truly is a movie that has withstood with the trials of time and proves to be a movie that you can watch again and again and it actually never loses its appeal or charm.Writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale managed to put together a very original story here  one that captivates the audience from the very beginning and keeps a grip on the audience until the very end. The story told in ""Back to the Future"" is a story that has so many aspects and so many topics that there definitely is something that appeal to everyone in the audience; ranging from romance  action to science fiction.There is a great pacing to the movie  and director Robert Zemeckis ensured that the movie never left momentum or dropped down in its pacing. This definitely made the movie all the more enjoyable and certainly ensured that the movie can be watched again and again.The movie is packed with great actors and actresses. Of course the movie is so phenomenally well carried by Michael J. Fox in the lead role as Marty McFly  and he definitely made that character lovable and memorable. But right up alongside Fox was Christopher Lloyd in the memorable role as the eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown. Who can't claim to be familiar with the expression ""Great Scott!""? Furthermore  the movie also brought along Lea Thompson  Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson  whom individually also brought a lot of contents to the movie with their appearances and performances.I can't count the number of times that I have watched this movie  nor the other two in the franchise for that matter. But the original 1985 ""Back to the Future"" is a classic in every meaning of the word.While the movie is from 1985  then the special effects still holds solid even in 2019. Sure they wear symptoms of aging  certainly  but still the special effects are quite good. And back in 1985  they were off the charts.If you  for some unknown reason  never have gotten acquainted with ""Back to the Future""  then shame on you. This is a movie that you HAVE to watch. ""Back to the Future"" is one of those movies that you need to watch regardless of your age  creed and standing.",positive

Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly  fine support from the lovely Lea Thompson  quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd  amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM  and a rocking 80s soundtrack.A wonderful film that is as fresh and entertaining today  despite its inescapable 80s style  I have no doubt that Back To The Future will continue to captivate audiences young and old well after my generation is history: my kids sure loved it  and I hope that when they have kids of their own  theirs will too.

After their film Used Cars came out  Gale was looking through his father's high school yearbook. His mother wondered if he would have been friends with his father. Time travel was the only way they'd get the answer.The duo wanted to make a time travel film that showed that the past could change the future. And sure  Professor Brown was once a video pirate and the time machine was going to be powered by Coke  but the main story remained the same as the movie was finally sold.Then the movie went into turnaround and forty different studios turned down the movie. Other time travel films like Time Bandits and The Final Countdown had underpeformed and Disney was put off by the fact that the hero made out with his mom. I mean  well  yeah.Steven Spielberg believed in them and the script. And that ended up being enough.That and the fact that Zemeckis had a success with Romancing the Stone and had the clout to make the movie. And a grudge against the studios who turned him down  so he sold the movie to Spielberg's Amblin  who set the project up at Universal Studios. However  that's also where Frank Price  the first person to say no  worked. Spielberg didn't like Price either - he'd passed on E. T. - so Sidney Sheinberg became the chief executive to oversee the studio's investment.For his part  Sheinberg wanted to rename the movie Space Man from Pluto because he believed Back to the Future wouldn't sell. Everyone worried how to deal with the venerable elder man until Spielberg diffused the situation by sending a funny memo that said  ""Hi Sid  thanks for your most humorous memo  we all got a big laugh out of it  keep 'em coming.""Michael J. Fox was the first choice to play Marty McFly  but the producers of his hit show Family Ties didn't even let him see the script. Eric Stoltz ended up with the role  but he was too intense. The filmmakers realized they hired a great actor for the wrong role. Stoltz also was a method actor and stayed in character the entire time  refusing to answer to any name but Marty  which led to the crew hating him. 34 days of shooting were lost - they kept shooting with the actor despite Fox being hired - and Stoltz was paid his entire salary.Another perhaps exaggerated story is that Thomas F. Wilson  who played Biff  almost had his collarbone broken in the scene where he fights Marty in the cafeteria. Take after take  despite Wilson asking Stoltz to calm down  the actor kept roughing him up. Wilson planned to get a reciept in the car parking scene outside the dance  but Stoltz was gone before that happened.Despite the issues behind the movie  audiences loved the story of Marty McFly going back in time thanks to Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and having to put back together the events that introduced his parents (Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover). What audieces really liked was the DeLorean  a car that was unlike any time machine they'd ever seen in a movie before.The one thing I never liked about this movie is that it posits that a white man now creates rock and roll. I know it's a minor part  but even as a kid  it upset me.Speaking of music  when Marty pretends to be Darth Vader from the planet Vulcan  he plays a tape labelled ""Edward Van Halen."" It's not any existing Van Halen song  but an untitled song that was written for The Wild Life  which also starred Eric Stoltz (and where producers discovered Lea Thompson as they studied Stoltz's work).",positive

So  it is clear that the first episode is the most popular  no contest  in both rating and number of votes.I  too  think #1 is the best. In fact  I think it should stand among the best films of all time. Not for any one facet  but for the total entertainment that it provides. Almost all of us dream of ""time travel."" BTTF certainly is not the first to explore time travel  but the way it does it is unique. Plus the fact that this is clearly a comedy  but one that is so well conceived and written that I never find myself think of it as a comedy. I've been a long time fan of Chris Lloyd's  since his days as Jim Ignatowski (""flower child"" spelled backward)  and he is so perfect as Doc Brown. And  of course  Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ""defines"" a role as few have been defined in films.The script is uniformly superb in all 3 versions  and to me that is what really makes them ""believable"" within the context of a pure fantasy. Plus  although all the ""science"" in the 3 films is ""bad science""  which for a scientist makes it even funnier  they don't overlook any details. They always offer a ""science"" explanation for what Doc is about to do  even though it is completely nonsense.Tonight  at the end of #3  I first realized one of the reasons I like the BTTF films so much. Ever take a vacation to a totally different part of your country or world? And when you get back home after a few weeks  to the familiar  you sorta mentally pinch yourself and think  ""Just two days ago I was riding a train through southern France  drinking wine by the river  and sleeping in the 200-yr-old silk factory turned home in the country."" And you look around  you're back home to a totally different world.That's what I believe Marty McFly felt when he arrived home  saw Jennifer asleep on the swing. He had just spent a week during 1885  evading a band of Indians  seeing his original ancestors from Scotland  fighting an infamous gunfighter  and making a harrowing escape from the past by being pushed to 88 mph by a train that blows up  and now he is back home to the familiar. We can all identify with that  and the end of each of the 3 BTTF films gives us that identification.The original  #1  involved the existing friendship between Marty and Doc Brown. Marty accidentally gets sent back 30 years to 1955  and must enlist a young Doc's help to get home. Meanwhile he inadvertently gets his future mother interested in him  jeopardizing the future relationship of his ""parents."" The old newspaper accounts of the lightning strike of the clock tower is used as a source of energy to get Marty back home. His fight with Biff in 1955 has altered history and his 1985 family is apparently much better off as a result.#2 hinges on Biff inadvertently getting a copy of an almanac for ""future"" events and he dishonestly uses future sports results to gain fortune and power  and drastically change the future. Marty and Doc have to retrieve the almanac before Biff uses it  to restore history to its proper order. It ends in a way that sets up the #3 sequel.In #3 Marty gets a Western Union letter that Doc Brown had actually written in 1885 and requested delivery at the specific time in the future. Doc has ended up in 1885  is content  and insists that Marty not try to interfere. However  Marty discovers a tombstone and historical account of Doc being shot in the back over an $80 issue. So Marty has to go back and help Doc avoid that fate. To me  the original is definitely the better of the 3. The second and third ones are totally different  and I would rate them about the same. The science is funky  a rigorous analysis can uncover a number of ""discrepancies""  but to me none of that matters. The BTTF films are just great fun  and the good guys always come out on top. And there's nothing wrong with that.2015 UPDATE: I bought the 3-disk BluRay set and they really are an upgrade from the DVDs  better picture and sound.",negative

Because the second one took place partially on October 21  2015 was the reason for this series playing for that one day. Anyway  this first one was the best of them mainly because of the contrast between teen Marty McFly's '80s lifestyle and that of his parents' when they were teens in the '50s. Also  his relationship with Doc Brown was also a big part of the movie's phenomenal success. That and plenty of jokes about culture shock and great chase scenes. My favorite scene involved Marty playing heavy metal licks at the '50s dance sequence. And what great players like Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd handling their roles the way they do! And  yes  Lea Thompson  Crispin Glover  and Thomas F. Wilson are also fine as Marty's parents and his father's bully  respectively. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale fashioned a fine screenplay with excellent direction from Zemeckis. This is still my favorite '80s movie  bar none! So on that note  I definitely highly recommend Back to the Future. P.S. One of the most interesting things I now know about this movie is that the younger brother of Lorraine in the '50s sequence was played by Jason Hervey who was also in the other summer blockbuster of the summer of '85-Pee Wee's Big Adventure-and would later play Kevin Arnold's older brother  Wayne  on ""The Wonder Years"".",negative

He both needs to get back to 1985 but before that to get his parents to fall in love with each other so he doesn't get erased from the existence.The movie is absolutely great. It has so much energy and there is always something happening. It is also great to look into the past. Nowadays 1985 is old times as well so the movie has twice the charm when we get to see both the 80's and the 50's. And the writers did a great job to make jokes to show us the differences between those times. Even as somebody who hasn't lived in the 50's I could get them  and the jokes about let's say Marty's 80's vest are even more hilarious to us now. So the movie aged very well  if it didn't even get better.The casting is also perfect. Michael J. Fox is the right actor for Marty. He was not the one cast at first but I am so glad they got him. Even though Eric Stoltz is a great actor  but the footage with him from Back to the Future had a more serious feeling to it  it kind of was losing the charm I love so much. Maybe then there would be no other sequels.Christopher Lloyd created a great persona as Doc. If I see a picture of him I would always recognize him. He always has this great crazy scientist in him. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover who played Marty's parents made a wonderful performance by being them at different ages. The make up artists also contributed to the success of it.I loved this movie as a kid  I love it now. It has everything that I like for such a genre: great cast  a fun story  great lines  well connected plot and perfect time setting. One of the movies I can watch again and again.,positive

To take on themes as risky as paradoxes and time loops you primarily need a healthy dose of courage and ambition  but most importantly loads of writing talent and cinematic vision. The scenario of ""Back to the Future""  courtesy of director Robert Zemeckis and co-producer Bob Gale  is honestly one of the most brilliant ones ever penned down and  thanks to the financial support of several acclaimed producers (including Steven Spielberg and Frank Marshall)  it also became one of the most massively entertaining films of all time  with sublime special & sound effects  diversity of genres and some of the greatest casting choices and acting performances ever. ""Back to the Future"" is quintessentially speaking a Sci-Fi comedy  but Robert Zemeckis admirably also hints at the more emotional and melodramatic aspects regarding time traveling. Also  even though the film boosts some of the greatest effects ever  their use merely remains functional and occasionally  so that the emphasis continuously lies on the story and the development of the characters instead of on flamboyant machinery and overlong speeches about scientific theories. The DeLorean is a stylish and original piece of scenery  but other than the fantastic and already legendary vehicle there are no giant laboratories with thousands of flickering lights. Marty McFly is a typical mid-80's teenager with a skateboard he knows how to use and a delightful high school sweetheart that loves him very much. His parents George and Lorraine  however  are a pitiable and hopelessly old-fashioned couple and thus he spends most of his free time with his genius but slightly eccentric friend Doc Brown. The latter invented a time-traveling device and  following a series of bizarre events  Marty accidentally travels back to 1955; the year his parents met and fell in love during the school prom. Marty has only one chance to return to the future  but in the meantime he has to correct the events he tampered with in order to save the future and even assure his own birth. The script is very well constructed and literally stuffed with witty little details that refer to earlier events and/or events that have yet to appear  either later in the film or even in one of the sequels. The humor works  the light-headed tone and atmosphere puts a big smile on your face  you come to care for the characters and the awesome soundtrack even makes it difficult to remain in your seat. Michael J. Fox  Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson all give away excellent performances  but my two preferred roles are for Christopher Lloyd (with his confused looks and bizarre facial expressions  he makes a superb mad scientist) and Crispin Glover. The latter appears to be born to depict weirdos and uncanny freaks  so the role of introvert and mysterious George McFly fits him perfectly.",positive

Being reminded of his work impressed me. What will we think when Zemeckis dies?Certainly we will be reminded of how he balanced fantasy and reality in all of his projects. Possibly it will be noted that he softened the Spielberg approach by unintuitively adding incoherence.I think I will remember two films: this one and ""Roger Rabbit."" These both are deceptively trivial. Was this the first mainstream movie that played as cleverly with time travel conundrums? It was not intended to spawn a sequel  and you can see that certain conventions were established that hurt the successors. But seen by itself  the idea of superimposing actors  characters and times in the same package works well. Makes this a gem.Notable is once again the scientist. You have only two types: pipe smoking  chin stroking blackboard thinker who explains  or what we have here. Lloyd is wildhaired  wild-eyed. A hardware guy  not an idea guy. An active risktaker  frantic in demeanor  but with apparently no sense of scope. For instance  he spends more time on a model of how to explain catching lightning than on the apparatus itself.The film revolves around his instabilities and mirrors those as instabilities in the world.

Despite having some great superheroes  the films based on their characters often have sucked. However  one of the best and most worthwhile films based on their comics is WELL worth seeing...""V for Vendetta"".The story is placed in a dystopian future. According to this future  the United States has been torn apart by civil war and disasters. And  the United Kingdom has gone from a constitutional monarchy to a repressive fascist dictatorship. But the government is far more evil than just repressing free speech. It seems that much of the chaos that led to this government was actually created by the man who now is in charge. To create a climate of fear and chaos  the government has created fake terrorists...and used the deaths of 10s of thousands of Brits as an excuse to control the country with an iron fist.The only hope Britain has is a weird nehilistic superhero  V. V (Hugo Weaving) is determined to bring down the government and give the country back to the people. But how? And what part does Evey (Natalie Portman) play in all this? See the film.This is a very exciting and intelligent film. It definitely kept my interest...much of it because the whole thing (aside from the near indestructable anti-hero) seemed possible! Well worth seeing and exceptionally well made.By the way  if you like this film  try the 1960s Italian film ""Danger: Diabolik"". Both have very  very similar themes and both are wonderful movies.",positive

I will say  as someone who hasn't read the book  that it is not a terrible movie  just underwhelming.Pros: The best thing about V for Vendetta was by far the visuals. The whole film looks fantastic  the camera work and editing are smooth and stylish and the costume and set design are sophisticated. The score/soundtrack was also effective  enhancing the atmosphere when it needed to and had some memorable parts too.The lighting is brooding and like the score enhance the atmosphere effectively. The idea was also intriguing.Cons: What didn't work for me was the plot  things weren't explained very well or were underdeveloped  it was sluggish and it just had a very shallow feel to it. I didn't care for the characters either  like the plot they were underdeveloped and and lacked any sort of depth. The script is often stilted  the direction lacked efficiency and despite the cast the acting didn't work for me either.Hugo Weaving has moments when he is commanding but his weak dialogue let him down  also the characterisation itself seemed threadbare. Natalie Portman seems wooden here  while great actors like John Hurt are underused or forgettable  in regard to Hurt what was even more disappointing was that he suffered from both these things.All in all  I just didn't care for V for Vendetta  despite the stunning visuals  atmospheric music and the interesting concept. 4/10 Bethany Cox,positive

He rescues Evey (Natalie Portman) from the creepy policemen.The general state of affairs is too confused early on. Other than the crazed ramblings of a madman  there isn't much explaining. It's all generalities and high minded language. It would help to set aside a small segment to explain this universe a little better at the beginning. They really should have either concentration camps  unending wars  book burnings  or goose stepping. Instead the setting feels like today's world slightly shifted. It's not enough. The thing with George Orwell. He created completely new worlds. There's so much they could have done.V's voice is distracting. Speaking thru the mask is problematic. It leaves conversation with him cold and distant. It would be better to cut those scenes down. The pacing gets very slow in the middle. The police is chasing him down  but there's never a close call. It grinds down as they slowly reveal the history. It's way too slow  way too late. They should have done this earlier  in a shorter prelude section. This is what the 1st act is for. And if this is such a police state with control of the media  how the heck did that program get on the air in the first place? If Evey's torture is all V's doing  how much of the stories we're shown can be believed? Or are they created to convert Evey?,positive

There are many excellent lines in this Orwellian story  but I would like to highlight the following ones: ""People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people""; and ""Ideas are bulletproof"". The awesome Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" fits amazingly perfect to both scenes of explosion. ""V for Vendetta"" is not only a brilliant tale of revenge as the name suggests  but mostly a magnificent message and hymn of freedom.

It is not perfect but it is very enjoyable for what it does,11-Dec-06,"Evey Hammond is heading out after curfew when the Government's Finger Men catch her and decide to enact their own form of justice on her. Her only rescue comes in the form of a masked man in a cape. This man then proceeds to show her the destruction of the Old Bailey. The Government spring into action to spin the story  control the people and find the terrorist. The police track Evey from CCTV and head to her work place (the Government controlled television station) to detain her. ""V"" arrives before them and uses the emergency station to broadcast his own message of unrest  elevating his ""terrorist"" stance against the Government in a year long war that will culminate on the 5th November one way or the other.It probably helps to be in the UK to really appreciate what this film does well. I don't mean that in a snobby way but it is a success of the film that it produces a vision of the UK that is both futuristic but yet recognisable as our current condition. It does this most easily by visually mixing the design of homes and people's lives with all the trimmings of a totalitarian state but it also does it by making the links to our current political state of control and Government intrusion in the name of ""terrorism control"" and protection. Although it is only a year old  the film still shows a lot of foresight when viewed with hindsight and in doing so it produces an effectively bleak attack on our current political climate. It is effective mainly because it doesn't ever feel that far fetched thanks to the details but mainly thanks to the overriding themes of fear and control being used by a Government.The surprise and joy of finding this level of social commentary in a what appeared to be a Hollywood action movie helped cover up some of the weaknesses. Some viewers have complained about the lack of action in the film; personally I do not see this as a weakness because this is more to do with how the film was sold rather than how it was made. The weaknesses are minor and include the asks the plot makes in regards the ability of V to do what he does and how far-fetched some of it is etc but  like I said  these are covered by how relevant and interesting I found the story. The cast are mostly good. It took me a good twenty minutes to accept Portman's accent but after that she won me over. She is very much in the shadow of Weaving  who shows what a great voice he has by producing a wonderful character without a glimpse of his face throughout. Rea is a bit dour but he does convince as a worn-down public servant faced with the truth about his masters. Fry wasn't that good but does what he had to do in a small role. Hurt and Pigott-Smith are both very good; Hurt particularly convinced as the sort of person who rises to power and delivered convincing lines in a convincing manner  it is telling he has little screen time but a large impact. McTeigue direction was surprisingly good and he delivered the whole affair with a real downbeat air while I'm sure some pressure must have been on him to deliver a big budget action movie for the summer season. He is well supported by the designers behind the visuals.Those seeking action to compare with the Matrix (or even action) will feel let down and I can understand why  the trailers have talked up this side and talked down the social commentary side (and this is a damning verdict of how public tastes are viewed from Hollywood) but credit to the makers for producing a film that surprised me by how relevant it was. Over the coming years this will either become a thing of its time or more relevant than ever (I hope the former) but right now it is an effective story  told with the unreal air of graphic novel but with enough to link it to the present to keep it relevant. I was genuinely surprised by how good it was and how engaged I was by it.",positive

That is the central haunting question presented in ""V For Vendetta""  a stylish thriller nominally adapted from the comic book of the same name. That the film comes out now is not surprising  what is though is that the source material was originally published in 1988/89  pre-dating by a decade a global world in which terrorism has become a household word.Comparisons drawn to Nazi Germany are probably apt  as the film's reining government and it's leader Sutler (John Hurt) have succeeded in convincing the masses what to sleep  eat and think. The revelation of Sutler's inhuman plot to save his country's citizens from a self induced plague that killed eighty thousand people seems utterly unbelievable  yet a real life Hitler found it prudent to kill nearly eight times as many to insure racial hegemony. It's interesting to note that the level of V's violence was tempered to each victim's own arrogance and complicity. Dr. Surridge (Sinead Cusack) as an example was already dead before she even knew it  dispassionate in the knowledge of her guilt and almost welcoming it.In a field of outstanding portrayals  Natalie Portman excels as the tormented accomplice Evey Hammond. Her performance arcs over an entire spectrum of characterizations and emotions  and not once did I feel her reactions were forced or unnatural. She grows Evey from an ambivalent  unthinking member of the hive to a leader  with more courage and determination than allowing herself credit for. It will be interesting to see if she's given credit for her performance a year from now in the next Academy Award go round.The film prompts me to seek out the trade paperback of the original story as scripted by Alan Moore in a ten issue run. My curiosity is also piqued as to Moore's public disavowal of the movie  for that I'll have to learn more. Also while still on the subject  the movie's opening credits Vertigo  an imprint of DC Comics  which was not involved in the original publication.With a movie of such complexity  another viewing is probably a worthwhile endeavor to pick up the threads that might have been overlooked the first time around. However if all you're interested in is an action movie  this is one you probably want to stay away from. Action it has  but it's the subtext and message that should be grabbing you  not the wizardry of flashing weapons.",positive

And seeing what kind of society the movie portrays  it's hard not to sympathize with the terrorist (or is he a freedom fighter?).The movie portrays an arch-totalitarian England sometime in the future. Because of the wars waged by the United States  the whole world exploded into war  the US got reduced to a third world country  and the fascistic Adam Sutler (John Hurt) seized power in England. Imposing devout Christianity on everyone  he rules with the slogan ""England prevails!"".However  Sutler's days just might be numbered. A masked man known only as V (Hugo Weaving) seeks to overthrow this dictator on November 5  to commemorate Guy Fawkes trying to blow up parliament. V had gotten disfigured some years earlier from an explosion in a chemical plant where he was a test subject  and thus wears this mask.One night  V rescues young Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from Sutler's thugs  and slowly but surely draws her into his world of rebellion. As it is  Evey has a reason to go along with V: her parents were political activists murdered by Sutler's forces. So what will this all come down to? I must say that this movie really draws you in. While uneasy about supporting terrorist activity  one realizes that there's no alternative. Naturally  that brings up the issue of the current state of the world. Is Sutler Bush  we may ask. (No  Sutler actually has a brain.) I think that my favorite line in the movie is ""We report the news  not fabricate it. That's the government's job."" All in all  this gives movies based on graphic novels a really good name. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie. Also starring Stephen Rea  Stephen Fry and Tim Pigott-Smith.",positive

I think out of the nearly 500 reviews I've done  I've given out maybe 7 or 8 of them. I'm not quick to throw a 10 on something because of some whim  you really have to earn it. This film earns it in spades.Natalie Portman is the perfect actress: obviously beautiful  but also a real actress. Some of the other casting considerations (such as Scarlett Johannsen) I just don't have as much confidence in. And Hugo Weaving  although never seen on the screen (at least not his face)  made a great V. It makes me sad that Alan Moore decided to preemptively disown this film  because unlike ""League of Extraordinary Gentleman""  this is a winner. (And I liked ""From Hell""  even if Moore didn't.) I'm a little partial to this film. I love the musical themes  the alliteration. I love the anti-government  pro-populace message. I do own the graphic novel. But underneath all that  this film offers it all.There's romance (and I mean actual romance  not just people screwing around on a gaming table). There's action  fighting and explosions. There's intense drama (I cried a few times  especially during the prison sequences). I suppose the humor might be lacking  but I hadn't really noticed because everything else is done in just the right amounts.If you like Portman  like good dramas and action films  and are willing to suspend your disbelief for two hours (there are some things that might be just a small stretch of impossibility) this is a must-see.

He warns everyone that in 364 days from that night  he will do what the real Guy Fawkes planned and blow up the Houses of Parliament. Orphan Evey (Natalie Portman) finds herself helping V escape from the authorities  and slowly falling for him. V by the way is a very enigmatic terrorist  or vigilante if you like  who uses a lot of poetry and Shakespearian dialect to get his points across.

V (which by the way in Roman numeral means five) is a very intriguing character  with knives and razors to slice up people in his way  and yet he speaks so poetically  you can't help but like him  and Weaving was the perfect choice.

Here Britain is governed by High Chancellor Sutler  played by the excellent John Hurt. We learn that he came to power after a terrorist outrage that left tens of thousands of people dead. Once elected he had set about building a police state where undesirables were eliminated.The main character of the film is Evey (Natalie Portman with a slightly dodgy accent)  a girl who is rescued from the police by a masked man known only as V  played by Hugo Weaving who performs well in a role where we never see his face as it is always covered by hid Guy Falkes mask.Shortly after rescuing her he takes her to a rooftop to watch as he detonates explosives that he has planted under the Old Bailey. He then announces that that in one years time  on the fifth of November he will blow up the now disused Houses of Parliament. He also sets about killing a group of people who have wronged him in the past. Inspector Finch  an honest policeman played well by Stephen Rea is tasked with bringing V to justice. The more he learns about V's victims and their connection to the government the more disturbed be becomes.Many viewers seem to consider this a left wing film that is attacking right wing values by taking them to an extreme; I never thought that though  to me it is a film about the evil of tyranny which would have worked in exactly the same way had the government been Stalinist.The acting is good throughout  the secondary characters were also impressive  especially Stephen Fry who played a television presenter who sheltered Evey at one point  in many ways his character is the non-violent equivalent of V  they even cook the same thing for breakfast.,positive

She decides becoming his ally and confront the atrocities of the nasty chancellor and his underlings (Tim Piggoth Smith) . Meanwhile   a detective (Stephen Rea) and his helper (Robert Graves) are investigating the terrorist events .This is a thoughtful and broody story containing a clever political criticism and is based on a graphic novel by Allan Moore . The film gets diverse influences   as the myth of ¨the beauty and the beast¨  ¨The phantom of Opera¨  the anti-Utopian literature of ¨1984 ¨ by George Orwell and   of course   ¨The Count of Montecristo¨  but we are seeing images from the classic film and ¨V¨ acts like Edmond Dantes . In fact   the screenplay of the film is remotely similar to that of the Alexandre Dumas novel 'The Count of Monte Cristo' as both stories revolve around characters who escape from imprisonment and proceed in seeking revenge on all of those responsible for their incarceration . The original comic series was originally created by Alan Moore . However  following his negative experience with ¨From Hell¨ (2001) and The league of the extraordinary men¨ (2003)   Moore decided to reject all money and credit from Hollywood on any adaptations of his work .

Good!,25-Aug-06,Based on the Alan Moore/David Lloyd strip of the same name (which first appeared in top British 80s comic  Warrior)  V for Vendetta is a thoroughly entertaining adaptation which will most likely appeal to fans of the source material  but may leave others expecting summer blockbuster style action a little bemused.V (Hugo Weaving  who remains masked throughout the entire film)  is a freedom fighter in the near future determined to bring down the bully boy fascist government that is controlling England with fear and hate. Dressed in a Guy Fawkes costume  he plots against the state (led by John Hurt's nasty Chancellor Adam Sutler) and the people responsible for both his mistreatment and the death of thousands.Although the film is not 100% faithful to the minutiae of the comic strip  the movie's writers (The Wachowski Brothers) have wisely not strayed too far from Moore's basic vision  delivering a script that retains the core ideas (the importance of freedom and individuality) yet still has time for a little wham-bam action.Whilst the movie is not a complete success (it's a tad too long and drags in a few places)  this big-budget adaptation of the relatively unknown (to the general public  at least) V for Vendetta is a brave move and everyone involved should be applauded. Although I fear that the appeal of the movie will basically be limited to fan-boys  I do hope that others seek this one outthey might be surprised by how good it actually is.,positive

But there is one man who has survived some of the past atrocities and is determined to set things right again  his own way. He simply goes by 'V' and his is a grand Vendetta. Whether a viewer likes this movie depends on what they are looking for. My wife didn't care that much for it  but I really enjoyed it. It isn't as stylized as  for example  'Sin City'  but to me has more of a 'Batman' feel to it. You know that what you are seeing is not to be taken literally  and much of it is social commentary on the dangers of government taking over the 'freedoms' of the citizens.Natalie Portman is into her mid 20s now and a serious young actress. This is a good role for her  as Evey Hammond whose mother and father both fell victim to the government. She meets 'V' (Hugo Weaving  Neo's nemesis in the Matrix) near the beginning of the movie  on November 5th  as they listen to a concert of sorts  while they view the Old Bailey being blown up  all orchestrated by 'V'. The movie ends one year later  on November 5th. I like the mask that 'V' wears  reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's 'Joker' face  but this mask never comes off  and appears to be bullet proof. The cast contains a whole host of fine British actors  including Stephen Rea as Inspector Eric Finch  Stephen Fry as Gordon Deitrich  John Hurt as the evil Chancellor Adam Sutler  and Sinéad Cusack as Delia Surridge. The movie contains much violence  much bloodshed  and has some very dark themes. But it is worth a viewing.SPOILERS FOLLOW. As 'V' systematically tracks down and destroys each of the enemies whom he had targeted  and police are looking for Evey  the two of them become companions of sorts. While Evey doesn't approve of all the killing  she begins to sympathize with his cause  and in fact falls in love with him. His final act was to be sending a train loaded with explosives into the Parliament building on November 5th. But as he is dying after the final fight  he walks away and gives Evey the option to pull the lever and start the train. It is  after all  her future world  not his. She does  and the movie ends with a spectacular display. NB - 'V' got his strength and other powers after surviving government virus testing and also a fire  the mask and gloves were partly to cover his disfigurement.,positive

But to say that I haven't been this excited about a film brought by Andy and Larry Wachowski  the Matrix creators  since their 1999 ground-breaker  is saying a lot. Some may not like the film  or may not 'get' it  as it does go for a lot of dialog and character development over useless explosions and violence (of course there's some in the film  but no in over-abundance). But it is  like the first Matrix  quite challenging in the futuristic story kind of way  taking more from Orwell this time at a look of totalitarian society and the humanism that lies beneath terror and fear through dominance. That it is also a well made and well acted film is much to its credit.And while the film is credited as its director to James McTiegue  who was AD on the Matrix trilogy  one can see the Wachowski's (possibly akin to the V character) pulling the strings throughout in their script and co-producer credits. They take from a graphic novel and churn out something rather epic  and complex. V (Hugo Weaving  in maybe his greatest performance without a 'real' face) has set the date November the 5th as a kind of judgment day  as one year from that date he will return to change the course of history. But in this year's time Evie (Natalie Portman) gets in the cross-hairs  and becomes involved in his vengeance against the government that did this ""monstrosity"" to him. Through this there is an investigation by an officer (Stephen Rea)  some good deal of back-story through flashbacks involving a tragic character who's life is scribed on a roll of toilet paper  and the whole story of how this totalitarian society in England came to be.It's through this story  of which even I can't say that much more  that the Wachowski's deliver some action  however more food for thought than some might come in thinking it will be. For those expecting the non-stop action that went with the first Matrix you might be disappointed. But if you come in with an open mind  like with the Matrix sequels  it won't spell what came for many as disappointment. The talk in those films  which became muddled through the action at times  isn't so here. And through the cast of actors  who are all very  very good (particularly Portman  Weaving  Rea  and of course John Hurt as the high chancellor)  there are some individual scenes that are just great  and entertaining  and involving dramatically in ways the filmmakers didn't quite get on their previous efforts. One favorite for me was the fake TV show with the two John Hurt characters in a comedy kind of scene. And the whole sequence with Evie in the 'prison' is surprisingly moving. If I could make criticism of the film upon a first viewing  yes  it is sometimes a bit 'talky'  and the direction is not as astonishing as with the ones squarely helmed by the brothers.But for any of the small flaws seen on a first viewing  I can say that they weren't enough to deter me from recommending it  enough even to say that it SHOULD be seen twice  even if there isn't much confusion on what the story or characters are. One thing's for sure  you're likely to see very few other science fiction dramas this original this year  if at all  and least of which challenge the viewer's expectations and intelligence like this does. And great song over the end credits  by the way.",positive

Suppose you gather groups of people by the millions to overtly support your enterprise  wrapped in gloss and foreshadowing. Suppose you decide to make it humorless and obvious; and to make it whole and logical not because it is those things but because your confidence makes its seem so.Well  you'd have what this film has built itself against. But you'd also have what this film is.Will we never learn? Do the brothers suppose they aren't paving the way for simplistic munchkin politics? If you want a subversive film  go to Greenaway.Yet  I can admire how this thing is put together. It is highly cinematic visually even though most of the thing is talking. But even that is tricky because the talker is behind a mask  so we largely invent the images in our own minds  prompted from time to time with inserted visions.The first half is the Count of Agatha Cristie  where we are presented with an old fashioned detective story except presented from the criminal's perspective. Serial killings are ticked off and we want to know why. Though we follow the killer  our inquiries are handled by the on screen detective.This is followed by an ""Oldboy"" segment  a radical shift  perhaps equally well done. And then we shift into ""Irreversible"" mode as we slide into the sappy movieland happy ending. Fireworks.Along the way  we are pounded with self-reference to video media: our heroine and her pal work in TeeVee. The central Valerie character is a filmmaker who incidentally creates the film we are watching indirectly by writing it on toilet paper and passing it as if behind a mask.Our hero is motivated by a certain old movie. Until the very end  we only see our political nemesis on a huge video screen  as his millions of victims do.This IS worth watching  but only for the way it is constructed.

V takes Evey to witness the blowing up of the Old Bailey for which he is responsible  the following day at the British Television Network studios V breaks in & broadcasts a message to Britian claiming he is a modern day freedom fighter who has taken the guise of Guy Fawkes & like Fawkes will try to bring the oppressive Government down. Sutler's security forces try to find V while he sets out on a personal revenge mission...This American  British & German co-production was the directorial debut of James McTeigue & I must admit that I am amazed that V for Vendetta is in the IMDb user voted Top 250 films (well within the top 200 as well) but at the same time pleasantly surprised because I thought V for Vendetta was a terrific film that has so much going for it. Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore (who has said he didn't like the film) & David Lloyd (who has said he did like the film) I didn't expect such a great film  while the original graphic novel was about V on a quest to create anarchy rather than freedom from an oppressive Government I think the film works extremely well & a lot f it seemed very relevant & topical. Lets be honest  V for Vendetta has a dig at the likes of George Bush & Tony Blair as it presents Britian in the near future as a society run by a dictator & a corrupt Government who have twisted the war on terrorism  the need for security & the fears ordinary people have to take away people civil liberties & freedom just like we are heading towards right now if truth be told. I could also relate to the way Sutler uses & manipulates the media  it's all quite close to home & familiar actually. At over two hours I was never bored by a largely talky film  it held my interest from stat to finish with some great writing  some touching writing  some humorous writing  some exciting writing & some satirical writing. The character's are all strong & there's one great twist about half way through I didn't see coming that was genuine surprise that at first seemed a bit odd but then after thinking about it seemed totally logical.Based on a comic book there's a great visual style to the film  from the cool fighting & action scenes to some surprisingly touching scenes sensitively shot. I loved the idea of using Guy Fawkes  I am not sure if he is that well known outside of the UK but here the 5th of November is celebrated every year & Fawkes story is know to all. The idea of using the morals & image of Fawkes & the ideas behind the image is a great one that works perfectly (but I guess you would have to know of Fawkes for it to). The special effects are impressive with a cool shot of the House of Parliment being blown up at the end. There is some blood & violence but overall there's more talk although when the action does arrive it's cool. I also loved the dominoes bit  sure it's pointless but it looks great & since it took over 200 hours to set up in reality a lot of time went into creating it.With a supposed budget of about $54 000 000 this wasn't as big budgeted as some Hollywood films although it does look great & is surely one of the most political films released during the decade  the parallels between the future society seen in V for Vendetta & the the way our own is heading is there for all to see & the similarity between Sutler & certain other well known leaders is also striking. The acting is great from all expect Portman who is a bit flat although tremendous credit goes to Hugo Weaving who manages to put in a great performance & give V real depth despite being hidden behind a mask the entire film.V for Vendetta is a marvellous film  both as an action fantasy with lush visuals & as an extreme look at where society is heading  the ambiguity surrounding the character of V helps too as a sort of masked hero who simply just stands for ideas & values. A new personal favourite of mine  I highly recommend it.,positive

Terminator 2: Judgement Day is considered one of the best sequels ever made  and it is a consensus that I agree with. While it does lack somewhat in its predecessor's darkness and brutality  it delivers just as much in the writing and action and feels bigger and richer.Here in Terminator 2: Judgement Day the budget is clearly bigger. This is especially true in the special effects  they were the only things in the first film that didn't hold up as well as the rest of the film but they were still not bad at all  here the effects are stunning  the liquid melting effects on the T-1000 model blow the mind still today. It is photographed slickly and beautifully  maintaining the dark audaciousness of the first film.  and while the sets and lighting are not quite as nightmarish they are every bit as imaginative and atmospheric. It is superbly directed by James Cameron  and it's scored appropriately hauntingly.Terminator 2: Judgement Day's script is just as snappy and even takes on a hard-edged tone in some parts  more so than the original  while the roller-coaster action is thrilling in every sense  without being overblown or dominating the film too much at the expense of depth  the bigger budget aiding and adding to the experience rather than swamping it. The story is still enormous fun  beautifully paced with few if any longueurs and very suspenseful.Linda Hamilton gives another terrific performance  that is more depth than her performance in the first film  Robert Patrick is spine-chilling and once again Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in by far his most conic role that was tailor-made for him.In conclusion  a fantastic sequel that deserves its distinction as one of the best sequels ever made. It's the only Terminator sequel to be close to the quality of the original  and the only one that's above good level. For me  if asked which is the better film between the first film and this they're about equal  in their own ways 10/10 Bethany Cox,positive

Obviously that reputation has long since been diminished by films which have come since  but I still remember the hype and excitement that surrounded this film when I was but a ten year old boy. Containing Arnold Schwarzenegger's most accessible  likable performance  it's difficult to find fault with this near-masterpiece of adrenaline-pumping action.Essentially it's just a string of set pieces linked together by a few scenes of dialogue. There's little drama or acting involved - all the characters are clear-cut - basically  the film goes from one outstanding action sequence to another. And these action scenes are truly wonderful. There are five in all; each more exciting and meaningful than the last. The first comes when the T-800 and T-100 finally meet up and have a huge battle in a hallway  smashing walls down and throwing each other through windows. The battle of the titans continues outside in a riveting truck chase  stopped only by a huge explosion. The third suspenseful set-piece shows just how unstoppable the T-1000 is  as the goodies and baddies battle over rescuing Sarah Connor from her mental asylum. Then there's lot of gunfire and explosions in the Cyberdyne building siege  until the final climatic battle between good and evil at a steel mill.If THE ABYSS was the first film to really introduce CGI  TERMINATOR 2 is the first film to really make use of its facilities and to place them in a context - unlike later entries which tried to make non-computerised things look real  and failed. The T-1000's morphing shots are stunning  show-stopping  and exceptional  and they work because they are meant to look as such. Aside from these excellent morphing sequences (the scene involving the T-1000 coming out of a floor is probably the greatest)  there's tons of ammunition and explosions flying across the screen at every opportunity. Arnie dons some realistic ""wound"" makeup in the final scenes of the film  and once again the makeup is flawless. The special effects are the best things in this film; the makeup  CGI work and stunts all come together in absolute perfection.The performance are spot on too; characters are introduced and are made charismatic  but thankfully are not dwelled upon. Edward Furlong makes an impressive debut as the streetwise  foul-mouthed kid who has a heart of gold  while Linda Hamilton has undergone a complete transformation from her victimised waitress in the first film to a muscular  lean killing machine herself. Robert Patrick helped to carve himself a niche for playing evil psychopaths  and his slim figure goes well with the morphing capabilities he possesses - he looks like a match for Arnie. But it's our friend Schwarzenegger who steals the film  starting out as a cold  calculating machine and in the end sacrificing himself for mankind. That this finale had me bursting into tears on more than one occasion shows just how good Arnie is in it. He's funny  heroic  likable and consistently impressive - what more could you want? Other familiar faces fill out the supporting cast  with the likes of Xander Berkeley and Earl Boen (returning from the first film) in minor roles.The violence isn't skirted  either...lots of people get impaled by the T-1000's knife-arms  plenty of men get shot in the knees (ouch)  Arnie even cuts the skin off his own arm at one point. But this is primarily an action film  and should be treated as such. Every scene is flawlessly composed  with some little neat ideas thrown in almost everywhere - everything is portrayed coolly and stylishly  especially where Arnie is concerned. He really is the king of cool here - from the flick as he puts on his sunglasses to the shotgunning open of locked gates in split seconds to his final catchphrases - ""Hasta la Vista baby"" and ""I'll be back"" to name but two. And still there's more to praise: a moral behind the story  a suspenseful score  excellent opening titles  no lulls in the film whatsoever  nice photography  crisp editing...the list is  indeed  endless. In my youth  this was my most-watched film  and I can still watch it over without ever becoming bored. A masterpiece  plain and simple  and one of my very favourite films.",positive

I'll go a step further and say this here is one of the greatest science-fiction movies ever made. It's funny but I still have vivid memories of watching this on opening night even though I was only eleven-years-old. I remember the buzz going into the movie. I remember who I watched it with and I can even remember what part of the theater I was sitting in. At the time I don't think I fully realized how special the film I was watching was because I only saw it as something extremely cool with ground breaking effects. Today I see the film as a complete masterpiece of film-making even though one might find a few logical issues but then again this is science fiction so the logic could be overlooked anyways. I think it goes without saying but the story is the best thing going on here. The plot is a very simple one: the prevention of Judgment Day so what else do you need? The movie has Arnold Schwarzenegger returning and giving the greatest performance of his career. Linda Hamilton is also back and the way she transformed her character from the first film is pretty remarkable. Edward Furlong makes for a very good John Connor and Robert Patrick is terrific as the villain. The special effects were ground breaking in 1991 and I might say they haven't been topped in all the years since. Sure  CGI has come along but they can't hold up to anything in this movie. The liquid metal is pure genius and all the effects are masterfully done. You could pick any single one of them and hold it up as being some of the best ever created. Whereas the first film was extremely dark  this one here allows for the Terminator to have more character development and I think this was a great thing to do. Just as it was great to have Frankenstein's monster speak in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN  I think it's great to show a more humor Terminator. The jokes work perfectly and you can't help but find the ending very touching. No matter which version you watch (I prefer the theatrical) this is a marvelous film that has perfectly stood the test of time and delivers itself as one of the greatest of its type.,positive

John must retrieve his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the psychiatric hospital.The CG T-1000 is the most advanced FX of its times. For the rest  it is all real action. It still looks exciting and hasn't aged too badly. James Cameron has pushed the envelop to the limits. This is not simply Terminator on steroids. Cameron has added a lot of humor  and also heart. The T-101 is more a father figure to John Connor. And Sarah Connor's tough love really adds to the heartbreak. And the central idea that the future is still their's to create. All of it makes this more than a simple shoot 'em up movie. This is one of the best sequel ever.,positive

I haven't seen the picture since then until tonight  and even though it's twenty years later I'm still blown away by the special effects of the picture. The liquid metal alloy concept of Robert Patrick's T-1000 makes for a lot of clever mutations  with each one outdoing the one that went before. The one that really got me was when he rose out of the black and white tile floor of the hospital corridor. Very cool.Story wise  I always have a little trouble with these time travel gimmicks. It seems to me that Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) understood the unintended consequences of his work with Cyberdyne  and the science that came out of the remnants of the 1984 Terminator were handily disposed of at the finale. So Arnold and Company effectively saved the present day AND the future  except that the future happened anyway. I may be missing something here  but I'm not going to dwell on it.What I probably like most about the story is the relentless nature of the T-1000 to complete his mission  and the equal resolve that the Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 (that would be Arnie) has to stop him. Schwarzenegger once again parlayed his ability to deliver just a single line that has since become iconic - ""Hasta la vista  Baby""  getting by the rest of the way with his huge physique and a singular scowl. To her credit  Linda Hamilton literally got in shape for this picture by getting totally buffed  making her action sequences that much more believable. I'd probably be remiss if I didn't mention Edward Furlong for his portrayal as the young John Connor. I didn't really care for him at the start of the picture  but he grew into the role as the story progressed  becoming a sympathetic character by the time it was over.",negative

In ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""  Sarah goes all bad-ass to protect her son John (Edward Furlong  in an impressive debut). Oh  and of course there's the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) battling the villainous T-1000 (Robert Patrick)  sent back in time to kill John.Okay  so ""T2"" goes a little overboard on special effects  but it does manage to have a plot. The threat of a nuclear holocaust is always unnerving. Obviously  sending someone back in time to change history violates the paradox of time travel (meaning that if you change the past  then the future will be completely different  so there would be no incentive to change the past to begin with)  but this is a pretty good movie  as action flicks go. Among other things  it shows that when Ah-nuld tries  he can act.",positive

Sarah Conner's in an insane asylum  and a robot from the future has come to kill her son. But don't worry  because her son (in the future) sent his own robot back to kill the other robot and save the son (himself). Yeah  it might not make sense from a time travel point of view  but just deal with it.What to say? Arnold is great  as usual (though this is no ""Commando""). Edward Furlong is young  but does a fine job. I don't have the crush on him some people do  but he's cool. Robert Patrick is also awesome  even if he has creepy weird ears.

The T-1000 is nothing like the original; it is a liquid metal machine  able to change its form to look like anyone or anything of the same volume. To protect John the resistance and reprogrammed a captured T-800 Terminator and sent it back to defend him.When the film starts John is living with foster parents and his mother is in a secure mental institution still convinced that Skynet will destroy civilisation in 1997. The T-800 manages to save John from the T-1000 then  on John's orders helps Sarah escape. Once out she knows what must be done; they must find the man responsible for the creation of the technology behind Skynet and prevent him from finishing his work all the time staying ahead of the T-1000.Even though this film was made a quarter of a century ago the special effects still look very impressive and there is a lot of exciting and spectacular action there are shootouts  a truck vs bike chase along on of Los Angeles's concrete rivers  explosions and final chase involving trucks and a helicopter. Those who want action should certainly be pleased on the other hand it does feel a bit safe at times; John orders the T-800 never to kill making it like a defanged cobra; scary looking but no longer deadly. Arnold Schwarzenegger continues to impress in the role  managing to inject some humour into the character. Linda Hamilton is also pretty solid as Sarah Connor; it is interesting to see how much her character has developed since the original. Edward Furlong is okay as the young John Connor although his character can be a bit irritating at times in a way that didn't seem real. Robert Patrick did a fine job as the shapeshifting T-1000. The level of violence is considerably lower than the original; the T-1000 kills a few people but even when blasting away with a minigun the T-800 only destroys property and causes non-life-threatening injuries this of course means the film is suitable for a slightly younger audience. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the original; personally I prefer the first film but I can understand why others would rate this one higher.,positive

I enjoyed all three of the ""Terminator"" films but this one has always stood out.....because of the villain and the incredible special-effects. When this movie came out  the FX regarding Robert Patrick's cyborg-patrol cop were so jaw- dropping  so astounding that people couldn't believe what they were seeing. Some 15 years later  they are still cool. Watching Patrick morph into various characters is incredible  literally changing shapes or having his fingers or arms extend to an awl-like instruments. For a long time  he looks like the most indestructible ""person"" I've ever seen in a film. He certainly is still one of the most unique villains ever shown on film.Arnold Schwarzenegger  an intelligent but less-advanced cyborg  plays the only likable character. The mother-son combination of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong are too hard-edged  too smart-mouthed for my tastes. Hamilton was a lot more feminine and humanistic in the first ""Terminator."" Now she's ultra-macho and profane. Much worse than her is her kid  a real punk if there ever was one. There's something very irritating about Furlong  and not just the character he plays here. I'm not surprised he never became a star. Actually  a lot of the dialog in here is terrible and a testimony to the sleazy people who wrote the screenplay. The director  James Cameron  has done a number of similar films with foul- mouthed characters. Still  despite all these annoyances  as a fan of special-effects and a good adventure yarn  I can't help but keep watching this DVD every three or four years.",positive

Almost.Director James Cameron went in a somewhat very deviant direction with this sequel movie. And in my opinion he strayed a bit too much from the original storyline. Sure it was cool to see the T-1000 cyborg and its liquid metal ability  but at the same time having the T-800 model sent back to protect Sarah Connor's child was an odd twist of events for me.That being said  I am not saying that ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a bad or poor movie  far from it. Because this movie is action-packed and fast paced from start to end. I just personally didn't like the switch of roles all too keenly.Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton reprise their roles quite well  carrying on from the original movie. I can't claim to be overly much a fan of Edward Furlong  so in my opinion he wasn't the best of choices for the role. Robert Patrick  however  he was really well-cast for the role of the T-1000.The effects in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" were quite good  and the effects with the T-1000 were rather groundbreaking back then in 1991. And the special effects really helped the movie along quite nicely  because they added a level of believability to the movie.All in all then ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is an entertaining action movie.

The original was a masterful piece of low-budget film-making; with a much bigger budget and the latest special effects technology at his disposal  Cameron's sequel was a must-see.It didn't disappoint.Twenty years later: even though film-making technology has advanced in leaps and bounds over the last two decades  and budgets have got bigger and bigger  very few movies have provided me with as many perfectly executed cinematic thrills as T2.

I mean  this IS the movie where the end of the world has the most impact outside of Dr. Strangelove  right? One of those outstanding dream scenes in movies  one of the ones that actually works because it's true in its savage simplicity  Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor sees herself in her 1984 waitress get up with baby John in a playground and then everything gets wiped out by the BIG BOMB (Dmitri) that also incinerates Hamilton into BBQ.So it's with this kind of thought that Terminator 2 means to be the most kick-assingest blockbuster of its (or all?) time while trying to keep the loss of life very small - or  rather  the ""Bad"" Terminator who was designed by the wizards at ILM can kill to its mission's content - I mean  DAMN  it still looks great  and in its silver-liquid-chrome simplicity much more  for me  impressive than the clanging junk of Bay disasters. It's arguable  of course  that the Terminator (T-800) does kill some people  incidentally  or  you know  all that gas from the gun he shoots could make some people really screwed up but  hey  ""He'll live"" is enough.But if Cameron is ""soft"" at all here  it doesn't show too much... well  okay  Lil' John (hehe) does squeak and squak those early 90's amorphisms ""No Problemo - chill out - listen to Kriss Kross - etc""  and Edward Furlong is one of the things that just does not hold up here. He's serviceable at best  annoying at worst. He can cry okay though.But it's Arnold  in his swaggering low-key and then with an occasional grin awesome leading man turn  and especially Linda Hamilton who make this tight script so compulsively watchable. Hamilton makes Connor into what Cameron likely saw in his one-time wife/collaborator Bigelow - a take-no-prisoners soldier who can take charge and has muscles and can probably knock you upside the head (maybe that's why they divorced  he couldn't take all that woman... but I digress  at any rate he moved around a lot till his current wife) And there is also a vulnerability still to Sarah that makes her so endearing. She can never be completely hard  though time and experience and the dread of what's to come had scarred her  so by the time she has the chance to kill the Man Who Destroys The World  she can't do it. A scene like that is probably more emotionally gripping than so many other scenes that try in these blockbusters (something like Days of Future Past  which is a cousin of this flick  gets there). The fact Hamilton wasn't able to parlay such high caliber performance work into a better career is kind of sad  but at least this stands as a benchmark of a woman action hero  one of the two Cameron Wonder Women really.So  blast your Guns N Roses  say hi to the kid from Salute Your Shorts (that's him  right  Connor's friend in the first act?) and ride your motorcycle through LA - it's a bad mother-jammer of a blockbuster that holds up enough to look over its faults (i.e. some dialog isn't tight  like the voice-over  it's alright but whatever - perhaps it was ambitious enough to best The Perfect Action Movie  which the first Terminator just was).",positive

On top of that it`s very poor SF   if ten years have passed since the first film then that also means that ten years have passed in the future but as the original pointed out Cyberdyne systems had been beaten by the humans so how could they send another   superior terminator back to 1994 ?THE TERMINATOR worked so well because it was well made and written   not because it had an army of stuntmen or FX wizards. This seems to have slipped the producers memories. Here we are treated to explosions   stunts   FX   car chases  FX    explosions   helicopter chases   FX   explosions  FX  more explosions and a nuclear war featuring - you`ve guessed it - FX and explosions. The morphing FX might have been groundbreaking in 1991 but two years later every pop video   advert and TV title sequence had done the effect to death which means in a space of four or five years T2 looked extremely dated .My final gripe is down to the dubious morality of it all. Big Arnie goes around blowing the kneecaps off a whole SWAT team . Is it really necessary for him to do this ? I mean he is a terminator so bullets can`t hurt him so why`s he dishing out maimings ?I see there`s a TERMINATOR 3 in the pipeline. I predict it`ll be the biggest flop in years,positive

I'm not exactly sure  but I believe T2 was the first movie to use CGI. One thing is for sure  they were certainly the first film to use CGI successfully. They brought to screen only what minds could imagine when they introduced the shape-shifting T-1000 Terminator.T2 already had a set base as a story in the success of Terminator. T2 only built upon that success and made sure to one-up its predecessor. Besides the CGI there were some excellent shots and excellent scenes. Just to name a few: when T800 (Schwarzenegger) rescues John Connor on the motorcycle  the amazing slow-mo scene when Sarah Connor attempts to escape the hospital only to come face to face with the T800  and the fight scene between the T800 and the T1000 (Robert Patrick).T2 was a trend setter and a trailblazer  even other movies adopted abbreviating their title. The action was just right. Not too much  not too little  and not over the top to make you think  ""Absolutely impossible."" T2 was very well directed  as it had to be to overcome the poor acting of the three lead actors. It was an instant classic that will continue to be referenced forever.",positive

Writer & director James Cameron has outdone himself with this follow-up film to his seminal sci-fi  time travel  yarn about men and machines. In the original  a Cybernetic organism classified a Terminator appeared from the future to execute Sarah Connor  while the mankind resistance army of the future dispatched a warrior back to 1984 to save Sarah from certain death. Kyle Reese showed up and helped Sarah kill the Terminator. Nevertheless  although our heroine managed to survive the nightmarish ordeal and have a baby before she hightailed it to Mexico  Cyberdyne Systems acquired the forearm of the Terminator that she killed in the machine press and Sarah eventually wound up locked away in custody at the Pescadero Mental Hospital. Miraculously  Sarah's ten-year son John Connor (Edward Furlong in his first role) has been farmed out to foster parents  Janelle (Jenette Goldstein) and Tod Voight (Xander Berkeley)  but is living the life of a low-grade hoodlum ripping off automated teller devices at banks when another Terminator designated a T-1000 (Robert Patrick) shows up to kill him. Unlike the enemy Terminator in ""The Terminator "" the T-1000 is a highly advanced model that consists of liquid metal and can alter its shape. Essentially  the T-1000 is far more formidable than the earlier Terminators  and it gives our heroes a run for their money. As it turns out  the Resistance has rewired a T-800 (Model 101) Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger of ""Red Sonja"") and sent him back to 1995 to protect John. The outcome is a thoroughly exciting action thriller that raises the stakes where the villainous Terminators are concerned. Cameron and co-writer William Wisher have supplemented the plot with some humor as young John Connor helps the Terminator fit into society by saying familiar phrases. The T-1000 is a truly menacing adversary for our heroes and they have to keep on blasting away at it because it can repair itself in no time. As Sarah Connor  Linda Hamilton has undergone a transformation from being a vulnerable waitress to being a lean  mean doll who fights the Terminator. Initially  when John and the T-101 show up at the mental asylum  they have to battle the T-1000 and escape by the hair of their chin. You won't find a better sci-fi actioneer than ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day "" and some of the dialogue is funny.",positive

That doesn't have to include the fact that this is one of those sequels that are so much like the original that one could argue that it's partially a remake. What I'm referring to is that going by the first  it technically shouldn't exist. I am not aware of anyone who considers the predecessor of this to be the only film in this series(I've experienced many who  with good cause  deny there to be a third movie... heck  I am one of them)  but I could see why there could be. However  if you look past that(and you ought to at least consider doing so  as this doesn't come off as one of those follow-ups released to cash in on an earlier success)  you're in for an undeniably enjoyable and well-done cinematic experience. The plot is interesting and well-told. The pacing is solid. The acting is great from all  Patrick is an incredible addition  and neither Arnie nor Linda have forgotten how to portray their role. The action gets bigger  and still consists of fights  shootouts and car chases  all of which are marvelous and exciting  and never degenerates into stupidity. The guns are still impeccably well-chosen and handled. Really cool. The new concept or two herein are very smart and well-thought out. The science fiction remains well-done. This holds an appropriate amount and volume of self-irony over the title character(though I did not mind the seriousness of the previous silver screen effort). While some of the dark tone is maintained  it is less violent and disturbing than the 1984 piece. There is also no nudity(well  just about) or sexuality in this. I have more points against this  meanwhile  they all give stuff away  and this will remain a spoiler-free review. And even with them  it's hard to argue with the quality of this  even if you prefer The Terminator to it(and I do). I recommend this to any fan of sci-fi  intense scenes  James Cameron  the others who made this  and/or food for thought wrapped neatly in celluloid. 10/10,positive

Despite doing exceptionally well at the box office  I just never was that interested in seeing IRON MAN and only watched it after a friend gave me the DVD. In hindsight  I am glad I saw it  but think you should know at the onset that I am not a huge fan of superheros and comic books. This means that the film did manage to win me over but also that I have no knowledge of the story nor do I have the devotion to it that a typical fan might have. Take this for what you will.Since there have been a bazillion reviews for this film already  mine will be rather short and I won't even bother discussing the plot--others have already done this very well. Instead  let's first talk about what I liked. The film was very slickly made and I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of the film. The Iron Man character and how he came to be was original. Also  I was thrilled that Gwynneth Paltrow's character was NOT like the one she played in SKY CAPTAIN (uggh)--having a tiny bit more depth and not behaving as stupidly. Robert Downey was very good as a world-weary jerk who grows as a result of his near death. What I didn't particularly like was Jeff Bridge's character--it just wasn't interesting and Bridges seemed awfully one-dimensional. Additionally  while I am sure fans loved the final portion of the film  it was a let down for me because it was all action. The previous 3/4 of the film was bolstered by good writing and dialog  but the end was all special effects. Still  I must admit that they were very  very good special effects.Final verdict--A very good comic book film but not quite as well made or as interesting as THE DARK KNIGHT.FYI--The character ""Pepper Potts"" appears to be a homage to the ladies played by the Monty Python actors in their series. Series regular  Graham Chapman  coined the term ""Pepperpot"" to refer to these dowdy and severely unattractive middle-aged ""ladies"".UPDATE 7/2010--I just re-saw this film and the second time I was even more impressed with it. Robert Downey's great performance  the terrific soundtrack and the wonderful plot--it's simply an amazing film.",positive

It looks fabulous  the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it)  awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences  which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload  all of which is laugh-out-loud funny  yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war  which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing  he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best  doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good  loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally  the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been  other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 9/10 Bethany Cox,positive

First he's quite the vulnerable one and second he's put together with extreme  but very human intelligence. Nobody came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond mortal men. No one got their DNA mixed up with some animal to give them some extra-sapien traits. No Iron Man is put together in a laboratory after a prototype is done while in captivity in a cave.That's probably both the strength and weakness of this film. Robert Downey  Jr.  Gwyneth Paltrow and most of all Jeff Bridges look like they're having a great old time putting flesh and bone on comic strip characters. I'm glad they enjoyed it  I didn't enjoy it as much as I normally do these kind of films.Iron Man is updated to today's world situation  but with some Thirties flashbacks because it's an arms dealer who is the chief villain here. Downey is like Bruce Wayne  a multimillionaire heir to an armaments fortune who likes to have a good time as well as work while Bridges minds the company day to day. But that MIT education did not go for naught as those Afghan terrorists found out. Downey proves as resourceful as B.A. Baracus of the A-Team in developing the Iron Man first to escape captors and then to defeat bad guys. And these bad guys are quite in league.But while the special effects are nice and the players are having a good time  Iron Man reminded me of a Popeye cartoon. Downey and Bridges looked Popeye and Bluto in the best two out of three falls. All that Downey needed to do was reach for that can of Spinach.I half expected he would.,positive

My money's on the latter  but a lot of people seem to rave over this comic book adaptation that sees a Howard Hughes-style inventor making himself a metal suit and using it to fight various nefarious characters. In recent years I've seen the superhero genre on the wane  with boring and predictable outings lacking the spark that earlier hits enjoyed (such as SPIDER-MAN and DAREDEVIL  although I know I'm in the minority in liking the latter). IRON MAN to me was routine  overlong and frequently dull  telling the 'samey' kind of origin story we've been seeing since whenever  and definitely lacking in entertainment value.It didn't help that Tony Stark's character grated on me from the beginning. We're supposed to believe this arrogant weapons manufacturer has a change of heart and wants to do good for the world  all the while retaining his quirky charm. Puh-lease! In actual fact  I was on the side of the (unrecogniseable) Jeff Bridges  cast here as the mentor-turned-villain. Bridges was the only one in the film who seemed to have the right idea what to do with Stark  i.e. beat seven shades of hell out of him.The plot plods along  taking trips to the Middle East along the way for some bloodless hijinks that see Stark building himself a suit of iron out of a few left-overs. BLUE PETER for guys  if you will. It also returns to the area later on for a rather entertaining fight sequence  but action and pretty special effects alone can't win the day for Stark. After the umpteenth confrontation  we're left with the sight of two metal men beating the tar out of each other in a climax lifted from ROBOCOP 2  and the ending drags on forever. Sadly  Stark ends up saving the day  which means that a sequel was greenlit.Other things working against the film: Gwyneth Paltrow's robot-like performance as ""Pepper Potts""  with whom Stark's character shares mucho dull flirtation. What did Hollywood ever see in this actress? Terrence Howard's military man is as dull as dishwater  and the only minor moments of fun come from watching our hero make implausible use of his engineering skills. But then  if I wanted to see that  I'd rather plump for SCRAPHEAP CHALLENGE  I think.",positive

I never was a comic book movie guy but my opinion on them has changed over the past couple years since directors and screenwriters decided to throw some brains into the film. Here's another fine example of a film that has something to say and doesn't just resort to non-stop action and slapstick violence. The movie is extremely well made  wonderfully acted and contains some great special effects and that makes it one of the better films of its type. I think the key to this film working is the performance by Downey  Jr. who makes you feel as if everything you're watching could really happen. I think a lot of times you really have to suspend your disbelief but that's not the case here because Downey is so great that you feel he really knows how to create this suit and make it work. I loved the early scenes before the terrorist attack when Downey uses his comic skills because this shows what a changed man he is after he is able to escape. The supporting cast is also very good with Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges doing fine work  although I felt both of their characters could have been written better. Gwyneth Paltrow is the one who really shocked me because I had seen many of her artsy films and was shocked at how well she could handle this material. The chemistry between her and Downey is great and adds a lot of suspense to the film especially in the final minutes. Favreau does a wonderful job with his directing duties and manages to keep the story movie and to keep the viewer entertained even though the final Iron Man doesn't show up until a hour into the film. I'm not a fan of CGI because I feel most directors don't know how to use it but that's not the case here because the effects fit in well with the story and they never try to be the main focus of the film.,positive

How Ironic!,06-Nov-09,I got a kick out of this film. I have never seen one of the comic books nor do I know about the exploits of this figure. It is a nicely done superhero film which traces the origins of the character. Robert Downey is quite good  balancing his innate arrogance against his good intentions. Jeff Bridges is also an excellent adversary. One of the most impressive scenes in the move is the opening in the deserts of Afghanistan as a roadside bomb explodes and Downey and a group of soldiers come under fire. It really gives one a sense of what those people face each day. It may even be a bit real for a fantasy romp like this is. It is down and dirty. There are great events  including the building of the first suit and his effort to exact revenge against the forces that have used his weapons systems to persecute and destroy the civilian population. There is a lot of action and it's not superfluous. Downey's relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow and the robots in his lab are a lot of fun. For pure escapism  it's really fun.

Once a lauded young television actor and Oscar nominee for ""Chaplin""  he quickly faced the dark side of show business  but in 2008 he pursued his great comeback. And he should not only lead the ""Iron Man"" franchise  but quickly afterward also become the new ""Sherlock Holmes"" and certainly a superior one to Benedict Cumberbatch. But lets get back to this film we have here. It received great audience numbers and critics reviews and was one of the main reasons why superhero films are so much en vogue again. But it's not all Downey Jr.'s achievement. Jeff Bridges created a nice main antagonist shortly before his Oscar win and then there is of course Jon Favreau's (an actor himself  also appears in here) strong direction and a truly excellent script for such a genre film.Its biggest strength is probably how well-structured it all is. The first third is about the hostage situation  the second is about Stark's change in character and the consequences and the final third of the film is what you may call the boss fight. I generally don't mind if we find out about the main antagonist right away  but it was also nicely done with the path they chose here. Then again  Marvel fans certainly knew right away. It was a very smart decision. The terrorists were the main villains for at least half the film until we found out who was in charge of them really and there is one scene way into the second half during which we see they are not in control at all. It's also a decent development that will not offend people that follow the religion of Islam  who may have seen this film as being too much against their faith otherwise.The film runs for slightly over 2 hours with credits and that's perfectly fine. No need to stretch it to 150 minutes and the way it is it also never drags and is an enjoyable watch from start to finish. The only somewhat negative association I had came with Gwyneth Paltrow who was occasionally cringeworthy in her few scenes. Then again  I do not see much talent in her anyway. And one notion about the Transformers-like fight at the end. I would have preferred that the way he could have won would have been with that reference to freezing armor  which was very nice and certainly would have been my preferred choice over a collaboration battle with Paltrow's character. It also would have emphasized again what they were telling us for the entire film. Stark may have been a bon vivant  but he is also a lone wolf. Apart from that  I was happy that the film focused a lot more on story than on special effects and visuals. I wish more superhero films would go that route.As a whole  needless to say now that I enjoyed the watch and will certainly rewatch the second film and watch the third at some point. And I am not even speaking about the other Avengers film that I will certainly watch at some point in the future too. Thanks to Mr. Samuel L. Jackson for leading us towards them in the post-credit sequence. As for ""Iron Man""  this was a pretty good effort I must say. Delivered in basically all areas convincingly and I urge you to check this one out. On a final note  I liked that they cast fairly unknown actors for major supporting parts here such as Yinsen and Raza  also something that other (superhero) film makers should go for in the future.",positive

This pleased his father  who was equally as skilled and had built his internationally successful weapons company up from the ground with the sole aim of arming his country to help them win the wars they face. When his father died when he was still young  the company went into the safe hands of friend and partner Obadiah Stane but  at 21  Stark came back onto the scene as head of the company and  it must be said  something of a playboy with a deserved reputation for loving woman and having a general cavalier attitude to life. However a weapons demonstration in the Middle East changes that when he is captured by terrorists and made to build them weapons. He escapes by building himself a mechanical suit and blasting his way out  but the experience has changed him and on his return to the US announces that the firm is dropping out of arms manufacture  an announcement that dismays Stane and the board  but not as much as his other plans would.Iron Man was more or less the first big film of the summer and  unlike the blockbuster season of 2007 it was a good start because Iron Man pretty much did everything that a Blockbuster should. It is big noisy fun  with good action sequences  comedy and effects and it is yet another superhero movie  which is the only thing about it that gave me cause for concern. The thing is  as good as some of them are  we also have lame ones where the focus is on the effects and nothing else. Iron Man is not the new Batman films but nor is it anywhere near the level of Fantastic Four  if anything it is like what one would want Fantastic Four to be like. I say this meaning that Iron Man has a solid plot (although the ""developmental"" film is generally the ""easiest"" one to get right)  fun characters and a good sense of humour thanks to the character of Stark  I mean  I like Batman's tortured psyche as a subject but Stark would be a lot more fun to hang out with.Towards the end  the plot suddenly moves past the developmental plot line and gets to the ""conclusion"". It is noisy and not as exciting as I would have liked but it is good enough to satisfy those who want to see their money up on the screen. For me the rest of the film was stronger as it focused on Stark  who is nailed by a perfectly cast Downey Jr. His acerbic sense of humour and real lifestyle of excess helps the film and he is an enjoyable centre piece who remains a presence even when he is just a CGI effect on screen. Paltrow looks good and fills the undemanding role well despite me personally not liking her that much. Bridges was a solid presence for the most part  even if not that much is made of him  while Howard is a good name to allow the series to continue with stars on board. I didn't think that Favreau would be up to the task since this is really his first big budget action film but  while not anything special  he did a good job and perhaps it helped with the humour to have him on board but we shall see if he returns with Iron Man 2 (which I'm assuming is a given as a project).So OK we have the Batmans and other good films this summer but for simple popcorn enjoyment  Iron Man holds its own. Don't look for a lot of soul searching (Stark's change of heart is more a plot device than a subject for exploration) but if you would solid action  some good laughs and a generally enjoyable product then this will fill that need till the next one comes along.",negative

Now I was never a Marvel Comics geek  my favorite characters were the mainstays of the DC Comics universe  like Superman  Batman  Green Lantern  et al. But if you were a fan  you couldn't help but know about the alternative universe that contained Spider-Man  The Incredible Hulk  The X-Men and Iron Man  which brings us to the subject at hand. I thought that the movie did a credible job of spanning the forty year comic book history of Iron Man about as well as could be expected in a distilled down two hour movie. Particularly effective was the way we see how the origin costume in the picture pays tribute to the early Iron Man years  while the modern day red and gold armor conveys the advance of science and technology into the twenty first century. Comic book purists will most likely have serious issues with the picture  but I've been able to get over the whole faithfulness to continuity issue some time ago. What I'm looking for in a flick like ""Iron Man"" is an opportunity to be entertained for a couple of hours  and there's enough here to have some fun and be just that - entertained.The one thing I AM looking for in the Marvel universe pictures is the ubiquitous cameo appearance of Stan Lee  creator of many of the comic book icons we recognize today. He's incorrectly credited in the cast listing as I write this  as he's listed appearing as himself. What you need to do is pay attention to that party scene in the casino when Tony Stark says hi to 'Hef'. That was just the coolest way to get Stan into the picture  and I give him a lot of credit for not taking himself too seriously as he truly is one of the gods of comic book history.As for the picture  it's easy enough to bash it for it's adherence to current world events and the milieu of extremist terrorism. But is that any worse than reliving the events of the early 1960's and placing the character in the middle of the Bay of Pigs or the Cuban Missile Crisis? The present day Iron Man can be a product of his time and still be effective as a symbol of patriotism and honor  even while the rest of the country is immersed in presidential primaries and partisan politics.You have to give credit to the selection of Robert Downey Jr. for the Iron Man role. Perhaps his own bouts with substance abuse uniquely prepared him for an outstanding performance as the conflicted title character. However the character I was intrigued with the most was Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane  I just couldn't get over his appearance as Tony Stark's operations chief. The role was played with just the right amount of reserve and just below the surface malice; I thought he did an excellent job. Gwyneth Paltrow had pretty much a thankless job as Stark's personal assistant and secret admirer and it didn't seem to me that her performance was all that stand out.As an aside  the one thing I feel I do have to comment on is a personal gripe of mine relative to the IMDb ranking system. As I write this  ""Iron Man"" sits at number #130 of the all time best films as ranked by current users. It seems to me that the way fans line up behind a picture even before it's released  there ought to be a moratorium of say  two or three years before a new release could be eligible for Top 250 ranking. When you consider the truly great films of all time like ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane""  it's hard for me to reconcile a popcorn flick like this one to be considered in the same breath. I feel the same way (as to a voting moratorium) about stunning pictures like ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood"". If a picture has the legs to stand up as an all time great  it will be remembered a couple years after it's original release. Remember all the fanboy hype about ""Serenity""? Does anyone even care about that picture today? See what I mean?",positive

As a comic reader for twenty years  I knew him and have come across him from time to time  but never really found his story that intriguing. He is  basically  Marvel's answer to Batman. That being said  this movie was excellent.I think they fit in all the necessary story parts  and they were executed wonderfully. Robert Downey Jr has finally made the comeback he deserves  and is bigger than ever. I am unclear about the Pepper Potts situation  but think it is being handled well in this film -- she is obviously conflicted  both in love with her boss but also wary of his womanizing. That makes sense. And the way they made his transformation from jerk to somewhat respected is a nice move.Purists might be upset that his origins were moved from Vietnam to Afghanistan  but that would just be protesting nonsense. In order for Stark to fit the timeline of the Avengers story (in the films)  he needs to be modern  and I think this was handled excellently.,positive

Basically Tony Stark (National Movie Award nominated Robert Downey Jr.) is the successful and rich head of Stark Industries  who manufacture weapons all over the world  and his life is changed when he is badly wounded in the chest. Tony is saved by a special metal based plate in his chest that keeps the shrapnel from reaching his heart  but he is also forced to create a new weapon by his Middle Eastern captors. In the time he has to build this weapon  he instead creates a metal armoured suit to make his escape and attack all in his way  and he manages it. When Tony returns to the US  he announces that from his experiences  he realises his company is not doing good making weapons  and he starts making modifications to his armour suit design. While Tony changes the design  manufacturing it with gold and titanium  and adding a jet-propulsion system to fly  his second in charge Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is still selling weapons to the Middle East. While in Afganistan  Stane comes face to face with Tony's original metal suit  and decides that it the new unknown ""Iron Man"" in the city  to go up against him. In the end  after defeating Stane  and against the advice of his crush-driven personal secretary Virginia 'Pepper' Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow)  Tony announces to America and the world that he is Iron Man. Also starring Terrence Howard as Rhodey  Leslie Bibb as Christine Everhart  Shaun Toub as Yinsen  Faran Tahir as Raza  Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson  Bill Smitrovich as General Gabriel  Paul Bettany as Jarvis and look out for Stan Lee as the man in the smoking jacket.

At least he was until he is captured by insurgents in Afghanistan and learns that it isn't only the good guys who use his products. Once they have him the insurgents instruct him to make them a version of his latest weapon; instead he makes an armoured suit that renders him bullet proof and even enables him to fly. Using the suit he manages to escape and when he gets back to the United States he renounces the arms trade much to the consternation of this erstwhile partner. Tony now devotes his time to making a new improved version of the suit which he uses to protect the people that where being oppressed by his company's weapons. He isn't the only person with an armoured suit though; his partner Obadiah Stane is building one too and when it is completed he will attempt to destroy Tony.I found the earlier parts of this film to be the best; Robert Downey Jr. did a good job as Tony Stark making his damascene conversion from arms dealer to protector of the innocent believable at the end the story was just about two giant robots I mean men in power suits fighting; although I'm sure that is the scene younger members of the audience will enjoy most. Jeff Bridges also put in a good performance as bad guy Obadiah and Gwyneth Paltrow was fine as Tony's PA Pepper Potts. I was rather pleased that they managed to avoid the cliché of Tony and Pepper becoming a couple even if it was hinted that they might become one in the future. Unlike a lot of super heroes Tony Stark has no problem with killing his enemies and the weapons he uses may mean some parents might not thing this film is suitable for younger children.,positive

Neither the action segments nor the lulls  the robot scenes or the soldier scenes nor the very low-key romance is overdone. It's all in good proportion. It's not an innocent based-on-a-comic character film but  frankly  what movie is nowadays? There's always some profanity and sexual innuendos that don't belong in a ""kids"" movie made today. Thankfully  that kind of stuff was a lot lower in content than the recent ""Transformers"" film I viewed.The scenes with ""Iron Man"" a.k.a. ""Tony Stark"" (Robert Downey Jr.) in his suit and demonstrating his spectacular skills were - no surprise - the most fun to watch. (If you have a chance  catch this on Blu-Ray as the transfer is terrific). At the end of the film we get another robot  piloted by the corporate bad guy ""Obadiah Stane"" (Jeff Bridges) and that huge Iron Man-clone is fun to see  too.Some complain the film is not really all that ""smart"" and it's a bit too predictable  but it's fun ride of escapism that offers a good two hours of diversion thanks to very good special-effects and mostly-likable characters. Speaking of characters  it wasn't easy to recognize Bridges with a bald head and full beard but once I heard his distinctive voice  I knew who it was. Gywneth Paltrow played a sweet role as Stark's loyal secretary  ""Pepper Potts."" (Nice name!!). The Afghanistan villain was credible. Actually  I liked him better than the obnoxious Liberal news reporter  who was annoying.The ""moral"" of the story the screenwriters preach is that military might as a deterrent to fighting terrorists can easily backfire as companies which manufacture arms for the U.S. could also be acquired by bad guys (because of greedy and corrupt U.S. businessmen). This is naive Liberal propaganda  the kind I would expect out of the movie industry  whether in Hollywood or Europe. Sadly  there will never be a shortage of bullies and evil people  who will then crush an unarmed foe as the people in this film attempt to do. It's also implausible any company like the one shown in this movie could so easily travel to a hot spot like Afghanistan and deal with terrorists. It's unrealistic  but that's today's movies for you. Also  despite the nonviolent message in the story  the good guy sure wipes out his share of people with a variety of weapons! For someone preaching peace  he sure didn't hesitate in killing opponents.Iron Man's metal suit is definitely very cool  equipped with about anything you'd need to fight an army of terrorists  or anyone else. The suit - and his super pacemaker - turn him into a Superman-type guy in that he can fly pretty high and pretty high. The latter part - how high he could fly - makes a nice conclusion  by the way  regarding the good guy's battle against the ""bad Iron Man.""",positive

Instead he invents something new  a rather crude iron man suit that he eventually uses to break free. But the experience changes him  as he sees that even the enemy have weapons that his company makes. His big decision when back home is to quit making weapons and instead concentrate on helping humanity.SPOILERS: When back home Tony works hard to perfect a sleek new Iron Man suit  one that can fly anywhere and even at supersonic speeds  and that has exotic weapon and navigational capabilities. In the process he has Pepper track down through company records how enemies were getting weapons. It turns out to be Obadiah  who is trying to get Tony killed so that he can run the corporation and enrich himself further with illegal weapons sales. The climax comes when Obadiah gets into a larger  more powerful iron man suit  and he and Tony battle. With Pepper's help he overcomes Obadiah  and in a conference reveals that he  Tony  is indeed the Iron Man.",positive

But at the same time perfect in a certain sensibility of entertainment for its audience. One should know what Tony Stark's as a character not exactly the usual 'with great power come great response-yada-yada-yada' thing. He has a more jaded attitude  slightly more cynical than your typical man-of-steel (wait  sorry  iron  or alloy as it is). I'm almost reminded a little of Bill Murray from Ghostbusters  only with the catch of him being like Bruce Wayne without the grieving dead parents aspect.He has lots of money  lots of technical know-how as a wonder-kid/multi-millionaire  and he drinks and gambles and sleeps with whomever he wants. We as the audience don't identify with him as average Joe- some of us would want to be him for all the hedonistic perks available. And  when the time comes  he can whip up a technological breakthrough under the most dire of circumstances (i.e. under pressure of death to make a weapon for terrorists and instead making his quintessential suit).But at the same time  when Tony Stark becomes Iron Man  he does have a level of conscience from the start  realizing that the company that is under his name (if not one he entirely runs) has been manufacturing big-time weapons of mass mayhem (dont want to put destruction in there  though it's pretty much that)  and wants to not want this any longer. Instead  basically  he takes matters into his own hands as some fantastical figure; instead of some army to take out insurgent terrorists in Afghanistan  he'll come and wipe em out in a jiffy. In this sense it's pure escapism  but also hitting on current issues (in the comic books it was similar terrain with him practically taking out Vietcong every which way). True  it might be much to imagine  but in the realm of a comic book movie  where we're already on the train of massive entertainment and being along for the ride of this character who can do what he does because he's that damn good.It's a thrill-ride  and it's very funny for much of the running time. And not unintentionally so like in  for example  Ghost Rider. It's genuinely hysterical to see certain things that make sense for Stark but are still wildly over the top in delicious ways (i.e. the strippers on the plane  yeah you read that right)  or in just little things with how Robert Downey Jr. plays it. And make no mistake  this is pretty much a textbook example of perfect casting for a tricky character like this to cast. You want the charisma and appeal of a leading man  but can he also have something to him that speaks of the moral ambivalence and seedier bits to the character? You can't do it with a George Clooney  but with Downey Jr. it's a match made in not-guilty-pleasure heaven. He's able to bring the audience for the ride as a strong hero  but also hint at the fact that he's playing this character for what he is  and not cheating or skipping around the edges. Without him  it wouldn't work anywhere near as well.But to give director Favreau some more credit where it's due  also should be noted the near coup of casting Jeff Bridges as the villain - and as a character who is  basically  the ""anti-dude"" as it were - a dastardly figure who runs all of the shady dealings of Stark Industries and reveals his hand at wanting total domination of Stark's technology for his own means. His is a performance to relish among the great comic-book villain turns. But also noteworthy are supporting players: Gwyneth Paltrow  where'd she come from for this part that works this well? Terence Howard as well  and a couple of other supporting parts  they all seem to click just as well.Which brings me to the director  who should get credit where it's certainly due; coming from work as an actor/writer  going up through Made  Elf  and the recent bomb Zathura  it's a remarkable achievement to pull this kind of work off. While it goes without saying the script is already set for him to go  he doesn't tinker with it or his style to make it any more aggressively stylish than it needs to be. His is slick  efficient film-making  and even with witty moments to match up the bigger audience laughs (watch how he keeps the camera still through the POV of the lens Stark has up filming his botched 'test' in his rockets). For all the praise that Downey (very rightfully) will get for his work here  Favreau's is probably just as noteworthy in mixing rousing thrills and blockbuster entertainment and action while shamelessly delivering on the cynical side of the story. Just the final line  and how its delivered and in the context  is worth the price of admission.Oh  and by the way  stay through the end credits. If you're geeky about anything Iron Man (or awesome actors in eye-patches)  you'll leave with a huge grin from ear to ear.",positive

That said  this was a pretty cool action movie directed by Jon Favreau with some subtle humor shoehorned in courtesy of Robert Downey  Jr. as Stark and Gwyneth Paltrow as his associate Pepper Potts. What a nicely romantic team they play here! While there's also Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges to fill up the capable supporting cast  I must mention Clark Gregg as a SHIELD agent who has his own amusing moments in his brief scenes with Ms. Paltrow. He's a regular on ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"".

I think it is not as good as the ratings suggest. The pacing is incredibly slow for a fantasy action hero movie. It's well over 30 minutes and Stark is still developing the suit! The plot is not very engaging either  it is not exciting enough. The characters are poorly developed too. I do not find myself care for any of the characters  except maybe Stark. Poor Gwyneth Paltrow  she is such a supporting character in here  and her role could be played by anyone. Action scenes are sparse and short  and not exciting at all. The subplot about battles in Afghanistan feels more like an oppositional political propaganda  rather than the story actually needs.

Despite doing exceptionally well at the box office  I just never was that interested in seeing IRON MAN and only watched it after a friend gave me the DVD. In hindsight  I am glad I saw it  but think you should know at the onset that I am not a huge fan of superheros and comic books. This means that the film did manage to win me over but also that I have no knowledge of the story nor do I have the devotion to it that a typical fan might have. Take this for what you will.Since there have been a bazillion reviews for this film already  mine will be rather short and I won't even bother discussing the plot--others have already done this very well. Instead  let's first talk about what I liked. The film was very slickly made and I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of the film. The Iron Man character and how he came to be was original. Also  I was thrilled that Gwynneth Paltrow's character was NOT like the one she played in SKY CAPTAIN (uggh)--having a tiny bit more depth and not behaving as stupidly. Robert Downey was very good as a world-weary jerk who grows as a result of his near death. What I didn't particularly like was Jeff Bridge's character--it just wasn't interesting and Bridges seemed awfully one-dimensional. Additionally  while I am sure fans loved the final portion of the film  it was a let down for me because it was all action. The previous 3/4 of the film was bolstered by good writing and dialog  but the end was all special effects. Still  I must admit that they were very  very good special effects.Final verdict--A very good comic book film but not quite as well made or as interesting as THE DARK KNIGHT.FYI--The character ""Pepper Potts"" appears to be a homage to the ladies played by the Monty Python actors in their series. Series regular  Graham Chapman  coined the term ""Pepperpot"" to refer to these dowdy and severely unattractive middle-aged ""ladies"".UPDATE 7/2010--I just re-saw this film and the second time I was even more impressed with it. Robert Downey's great performance  the terrific soundtrack and the wonderful plot--it's simply an amazing film.",positive

It looks fabulous  the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it)  awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences  which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload  all of which is laugh-out-loud funny  yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war  which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing  he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best  doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good  loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally  the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been  other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 9/10 Bethany Cox,positive

First he's quite the vulnerable one and second he's put together with extreme  but very human intelligence. Nobody came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond mortal men. No one got their DNA mixed up with some animal to give them some extra-sapien traits. No Iron Man is put together in a laboratory after a prototype is done while in captivity in a cave.That's probably both the strength and weakness of this film. Robert Downey  Jr.  Gwyneth Paltrow and most of all Jeff Bridges look like they're having a great old time putting flesh and bone on comic strip characters. I'm glad they enjoyed it  I didn't enjoy it as much as I normally do these kind of films.Iron Man is updated to today's world situation  but with some Thirties flashbacks because it's an arms dealer who is the chief villain here. Downey is like Bruce Wayne  a multimillionaire heir to an armaments fortune who likes to have a good time as well as work while Bridges minds the company day to day. But that MIT education did not go for naught as those Afghan terrorists found out. Downey proves as resourceful as B.A. Baracus of the A-Team in developing the Iron Man first to escape captors and then to defeat bad guys. And these bad guys are quite in league.But while the special effects are nice and the players are having a good time  Iron Man reminded me of a Popeye cartoon. Downey and Bridges looked Popeye and Bluto in the best two out of three falls. All that Downey needed to do was reach for that can of Spinach.I half expected he would.,positive

My money's on the latter  but a lot of people seem to rave over this comic book adaptation that sees a Howard Hughes-style inventor making himself a metal suit and using it to fight various nefarious characters. In recent years I've seen the superhero genre on the wane  with boring and predictable outings lacking the spark that earlier hits enjoyed (such as SPIDER-MAN and DAREDEVIL  although I know I'm in the minority in liking the latter). IRON MAN to me was routine  overlong and frequently dull  telling the 'samey' kind of origin story we've been seeing since whenever  and definitely lacking in entertainment value.It didn't help that Tony Stark's character grated on me from the beginning. We're supposed to believe this arrogant weapons manufacturer has a change of heart and wants to do good for the world  all the while retaining his quirky charm. Puh-lease! In actual fact  I was on the side of the (unrecogniseable) Jeff Bridges  cast here as the mentor-turned-villain. Bridges was the only one in the film who seemed to have the right idea what to do with Stark  i.e. beat seven shades of hell out of him.The plot plods along  taking trips to the Middle East along the way for some bloodless hijinks that see Stark building himself a suit of iron out of a few left-overs. BLUE PETER for guys  if you will. It also returns to the area later on for a rather entertaining fight sequence  but action and pretty special effects alone can't win the day for Stark. After the umpteenth confrontation  we're left with the sight of two metal men beating the tar out of each other in a climax lifted from ROBOCOP 2  and the ending drags on forever. Sadly  Stark ends up saving the day  which means that a sequel was greenlit.Other things working against the film: Gwyneth Paltrow's robot-like performance as ""Pepper Potts""  with whom Stark's character shares mucho dull flirtation. What did Hollywood ever see in this actress? Terrence Howard's military man is as dull as dishwater  and the only minor moments of fun come from watching our hero make implausible use of his engineering skills. But then  if I wanted to see that  I'd rather plump for SCRAPHEAP CHALLENGE  I think.",positive

I never was a comic book movie guy but my opinion on them has changed over the past couple years since directors and screenwriters decided to throw some brains into the film. Here's another fine example of a film that has something to say and doesn't just resort to non-stop action and slapstick violence. The movie is extremely well made  wonderfully acted and contains some great special effects and that makes it one of the better films of its type. I think the key to this film working is the performance by Downey  Jr. who makes you feel as if everything you're watching could really happen. I think a lot of times you really have to suspend your disbelief but that's not the case here because Downey is so great that you feel he really knows how to create this suit and make it work. I loved the early scenes before the terrorist attack when Downey uses his comic skills because this shows what a changed man he is after he is able to escape. The supporting cast is also very good with Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges doing fine work  although I felt both of their characters could have been written better. Gwyneth Paltrow is the one who really shocked me because I had seen many of her artsy films and was shocked at how well she could handle this material. The chemistry between her and Downey is great and adds a lot of suspense to the film especially in the final minutes. Favreau does a wonderful job with his directing duties and manages to keep the story movie and to keep the viewer entertained even though the final Iron Man doesn't show up until a hour into the film. I'm not a fan of CGI because I feel most directors don't know how to use it but that's not the case here because the effects fit in well with the story and they never try to be the main focus of the film.,positive

It is a nicely done superhero film which traces the origins of the character. Robert Downey is quite good  balancing his innate arrogance against his good intentions. Jeff Bridges is also an excellent adversary. One of the most impressive scenes in the move is the opening in the deserts of Afghanistan as a roadside bomb explodes and Downey and a group of soldiers come under fire. It really gives one a sense of what those people face each day. It may even be a bit real for a fantasy romp like this is. It is down and dirty. There are great events  including the building of the first suit and his effort to exact revenge against the forces that have used his weapons systems to persecute and destroy the civilian population. There is a lot of action and it's not superfluous. Downey's relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow and the robots in his lab are a lot of fun. For pure escapism  it's really fun.

Once a lauded young television actor and Oscar nominee for ""Chaplin""  he quickly faced the dark side of show business  but in 2008 he pursued his great comeback. And he should not only lead the ""Iron Man"" franchise  but quickly afterward also become the new ""Sherlock Holmes"" and certainly a superior one to Benedict Cumberbatch. But lets get back to this film we have here. It received great audience numbers and critics reviews and was one of the main reasons why superhero films are so much en vogue again. But it's not all Downey Jr.'s achievement. Jeff Bridges created a nice main antagonist shortly before his Oscar win and then there is of course Jon Favreau's (an actor himself  also appears in here) strong direction and a truly excellent script for such a genre film.Its biggest strength is probably how well-structured it all is. The first third is about the hostage situation  the second is about Stark's change in character and the consequences and the final third of the film is what you may call the boss fight. I generally don't mind if we find out about the main antagonist right away  but it was also nicely done with the path they chose here. Then again  Marvel fans certainly knew right away. It was a very smart decision. The terrorists were the main villains for at least half the film until we found out who was in charge of them really and there is one scene way into the second half during which we see they are not in control at all. It's also a decent development that will not offend people that follow the religion of Islam  who may have seen this film as being too much against their faith otherwise.The film runs for slightly over 2 hours with credits and that's perfectly fine. No need to stretch it to 150 minutes and the way it is it also never drags and is an enjoyable watch from start to finish. The only somewhat negative association I had came with Gwyneth Paltrow who was occasionally cringeworthy in her few scenes. Then again  I do not see much talent in her anyway. And one notion about the Transformers-like fight at the end. I would have preferred that the way he could have won would have been with that reference to freezing armor  which was very nice and certainly would have been my preferred choice over a collaboration battle with Paltrow's character. It also would have emphasized again what they were telling us for the entire film. Stark may have been a bon vivant  but he is also a lone wolf. Apart from that  I was happy that the film focused a lot more on story than on special effects and visuals. I wish more superhero films would go that route.As a whole  needless to say now that I enjoyed the watch and will certainly rewatch the second film and watch the third at some point. And I am not even speaking about the other Avengers film that I will certainly watch at some point in the future too. Thanks to Mr. Samuel L. Jackson for leading us towards them in the post-credit sequence. As for ""Iron Man""  this was a pretty good effort I must say. Delivered in basically all areas convincingly and I urge you to check this one out. On a final note  I liked that they cast fairly unknown actors for major supporting parts here such as Yinsen and Raza  also something that other (superhero) film makers should go for in the future.",positive

This pleased his father  who was equally as skilled and had built his internationally successful weapons company up from the ground with the sole aim of arming his country to help them win the wars they face. When his father died when he was still young  the company went into the safe hands of friend and partner Obadiah Stane but  at 21  Stark came back onto the scene as head of the company and  it must be said  something of a playboy with a deserved reputation for loving woman and having a general cavalier attitude to life. However a weapons demonstration in the Middle East changes that when he is captured by terrorists and made to build them weapons. He escapes by building himself a mechanical suit and blasting his way out  but the experience has changed him and on his return to the US announces that the firm is dropping out of arms manufacture  an announcement that dismays Stane and the board  but not as much as his other plans would.Iron Man was more or less the first big film of the summer and  unlike the blockbuster season of 2007 it was a good start because Iron Man pretty much did everything that a Blockbuster should. It is big noisy fun  with good action sequences  comedy and effects and it is yet another superhero movie  which is the only thing about it that gave me cause for concern. The thing is  as good as some of them are  we also have lame ones where the focus is on the effects and nothing else. Iron Man is not the new Batman films but nor is it anywhere near the level of Fantastic Four  if anything it is like what one would want Fantastic Four to be like. I say this meaning that Iron Man has a solid plot (although the ""developmental"" film is generally the ""easiest"" one to get right)  fun characters and a good sense of humour thanks to the character of Stark  I mean  I like Batman's tortured psyche as a subject but Stark would be a lot more fun to hang out with.Towards the end  the plot suddenly moves past the developmental plot line and gets to the ""conclusion"". It is noisy and not as exciting as I would have liked but it is good enough to satisfy those who want to see their money up on the screen. For me the rest of the film was stronger as it focused on Stark  who is nailed by a perfectly cast Downey Jr. His acerbic sense of humour and real lifestyle of excess helps the film and he is an enjoyable centre piece who remains a presence even when he is just a CGI effect on screen. Paltrow looks good and fills the undemanding role well despite me personally not liking her that much. Bridges was a solid presence for the most part  even if not that much is made of him  while Howard is a good name to allow the series to continue with stars on board. I didn't think that Favreau would be up to the task since this is really his first big budget action film but  while not anything special  he did a good job and perhaps it helped with the humour to have him on board but we shall see if he returns with Iron Man 2 (which I'm assuming is a given as a project).So OK we have the Batmans and other good films this summer but for simple popcorn enjoyment  Iron Man holds its own. Don't look for a lot of soul searching (Stark's change of heart is more a plot device than a subject for exploration) but if you would solid action  some good laughs and a generally enjoyable product then this will fill that need till the next one comes along.",negative

Now I was never a Marvel Comics geek  my favorite characters were the mainstays of the DC Comics universe  like Superman  Batman  Green Lantern  et al. But if you were a fan  you couldn't help but know about the alternative universe that contained Spider-Man  The Incredible Hulk  The X-Men and Iron Man  which brings us to the subject at hand. I thought that the movie did a credible job of spanning the forty year comic book history of Iron Man about as well as could be expected in a distilled down two hour movie. Particularly effective was the way we see how the origin costume in the picture pays tribute to the early Iron Man years  while the modern day red and gold armor conveys the advance of science and technology into the twenty first century. Comic book purists will most likely have serious issues with the picture  but I've been able to get over the whole faithfulness to continuity issue some time ago. What I'm looking for in a flick like ""Iron Man"" is an opportunity to be entertained for a couple of hours  and there's enough here to have some fun and be just that - entertained.The one thing I AM looking for in the Marvel universe pictures is the ubiquitous cameo appearance of Stan Lee  creator of many of the comic book icons we recognize today. He's incorrectly credited in the cast listing as I write this  as he's listed appearing as himself. What you need to do is pay attention to that party scene in the casino when Tony Stark says hi to 'Hef'. That was just the coolest way to get Stan into the picture  and I give him a lot of credit for not taking himself too seriously as he truly is one of the gods of comic book history.As for the picture  it's easy enough to bash it for it's adherence to current world events and the milieu of extremist terrorism. But is that any worse than reliving the events of the early 1960's and placing the character in the middle of the Bay of Pigs or the Cuban Missile Crisis? The present day Iron Man can be a product of his time and still be effective as a symbol of patriotism and honor  even while the rest of the country is immersed in presidential primaries and partisan politics.You have to give credit to the selection of Robert Downey Jr. for the Iron Man role. Perhaps his own bouts with substance abuse uniquely prepared him for an outstanding performance as the conflicted title character. However the character I was intrigued with the most was Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane  I just couldn't get over his appearance as Tony Stark's operations chief. The role was played with just the right amount of reserve and just below the surface malice; I thought he did an excellent job. Gwyneth Paltrow had pretty much a thankless job as Stark's personal assistant and secret admirer and it didn't seem to me that her performance was all that stand out.As an aside  the one thing I feel I do have to comment on is a personal gripe of mine relative to the IMDb ranking system. As I write this  ""Iron Man"" sits at number #130 of the all time best films as ranked by current users. It seems to me that the way fans line up behind a picture even before it's released  there ought to be a moratorium of say  two or three years before a new release could be eligible for Top 250 ranking. When you consider the truly great films of all time like ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane""  it's hard for me to reconcile a popcorn flick like this one to be considered in the same breath. I feel the same way (as to a voting moratorium) about stunning pictures like ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood"". If a picture has the legs to stand up as an all time great  it will be remembered a couple years after it's original release. Remember all the fanboy hype about ""Serenity""? Does anyone even care about that picture today? See what I mean?",positive

As a comic reader for twenty years  I knew him and have come across him from time to time  but never really found his story that intriguing. He is  basically  Marvel's answer to Batman. That being said  this movie was excellent.I think they fit in all the necessary story parts  and they were executed wonderfully. Robert Downey Jr has finally made the comeback he deserves  and is bigger than ever. I am unclear about the Pepper Potts situation  but think it is being handled well in this film -- she is obviously conflicted  both in love with her boss but also wary of his womanizing. That makes sense. And the way they made his transformation from jerk to somewhat respected is a nice move.Purists might be upset that his origins were moved from Vietnam to Afghanistan  but that would just be protesting nonsense. In order for Stark to fit the timeline of the Avengers story (in the films)  he needs to be modern  and I think this was handled excellently.,positive

Basically Tony Stark (National Movie Award nominated Robert Downey Jr.) is the successful and rich head of Stark Industries  who manufacture weapons all over the world  and his life is changed when he is badly wounded in the chest. Tony is saved by a special metal based plate in his chest that keeps the shrapnel from reaching his heart  but he is also forced to create a new weapon by his Middle Eastern captors. In the time he has to build this weapon  he instead creates a metal armoured suit to make his escape and attack all in his way  and he manages it. When Tony returns to the US  he announces that from his experiences  he realises his company is not doing good making weapons  and he starts making modifications to his armour suit design. While Tony changes the design  manufacturing it with gold and titanium  and adding a jet-propulsion system to fly  his second in charge Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is still selling weapons to the Middle East. While in Afganistan  Stane comes face to face with Tony's original metal suit  and decides that it the new unknown ""Iron Man"" in the city  to go up against him. In the end  after defeating Stane  and against the advice of his crush-driven personal secretary Virginia 'Pepper' Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow)  Tony announces to America and the world that he is Iron Man. Also starring Terrence Howard as Rhodey  Leslie Bibb as Christine Everhart  Shaun Toub as Yinsen  Faran Tahir as Raza  Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson  Bill Smitrovich as General Gabriel  Paul Bettany as Jarvis and look out for Stan Lee as the man in the smoking jacket. Downey Jr. has been away as a leading star for a while  and this is a fantastic return for him  and he has great support from a reliable Paltrow  and a mean performance from Bridges. There is good action and adventure  there are great special effects coupled with cool gadgets  and a quite engaging story to carry you along  it is a great fantasy superhero movie.

At least he was until he is captured by insurgents in Afghanistan and learns that it isn't only the good guys who use his products. Once they have him the insurgents instruct him to make them a version of his latest weapon; instead he makes an armoured suit that renders him bullet proof and even enables him to fly. Using the suit he manages to escape and when he gets back to the United States he renounces the arms trade much to the consternation of this erstwhile partner. Tony now devotes his time to making a new improved version of the suit which he uses to protect the people that where being oppressed by his company's weapons. He isn't the only person with an armoured suit though; his partner Obadiah Stane is building one too and when it is completed he will attempt to destroy Tony.I found the earlier parts of this film to be the best; Robert Downey Jr. did a good job as Tony Stark making his damascene conversion from arms dealer to protector of the innocent believable at the end the story was just about two giant robots I mean men in power suits fighting; although I'm sure that is the scene younger members of the audience will enjoy most. Jeff Bridges also put in a good performance as bad guy Obadiah and Gwyneth Paltrow was fine as Tony's PA Pepper Potts. I was rather pleased that they managed to avoid the cliché of Tony and Pepper becoming a couple even if it was hinted that they might become one in the future. Unlike a lot of super heroes Tony Stark has no problem with killing his enemies and the weapons he uses may mean some parents might not thing this film is suitable for younger children.,positive

Neither the action segments nor the lulls  the robot scenes or the soldier scenes nor the very low-key romance is overdone. It's all in good proportion. It's not an innocent based-on-a-comic character film but  frankly  what movie is nowadays? There's always some profanity and sexual innuendos that don't belong in a ""kids"" movie made today. Thankfully  that kind of stuff was a lot lower in content than the recent ""Transformers"" film I viewed.The scenes with ""Iron Man"" a.k.a. ""Tony Stark"" (Robert Downey Jr.) in his suit and demonstrating his spectacular skills were - no surprise - the most fun to watch. (If you have a chance  catch this on Blu-Ray as the transfer is terrific). At the end of the film we get another robot  piloted by the corporate bad guy ""Obadiah Stane"" (Jeff Bridges) and that huge Iron Man-clone is fun to see  too.Some complain the film is not really all that ""smart"" and it's a bit too predictable  but it's fun ride of escapism that offers a good two hours of diversion thanks to very good special-effects and mostly-likable characters. Speaking of characters  it wasn't easy to recognize Bridges with a bald head and full beard but once I heard his distinctive voice  I knew who it was. Gywneth Paltrow played a sweet role as Stark's loyal secretary  ""Pepper Potts."" (Nice name!!). The Afghanistan villain was credible. Actually  I liked him better than the obnoxious Liberal news reporter  who was annoying.The ""moral"" of the story the screenwriters preach is that military might as a deterrent to fighting terrorists can easily backfire as companies which manufacture arms for the U.S. could also be acquired by bad guys (because of greedy and corrupt U.S. businessmen). This is naive Liberal propaganda  the kind I would expect out of the movie industry  whether in Hollywood or Europe. Sadly  there will never be a shortage of bullies and evil people  who will then crush an unarmed foe as the people in this film attempt to do. It's also implausible any company like the one shown in this movie could so easily travel to a hot spot like Afghanistan and deal with terrorists. It's unrealistic  but that's today's movies for you. Also  despite the nonviolent message in the story  the good guy sure wipes out his share of people with a variety of weapons! For someone preaching peace  he sure didn't hesitate in killing opponents.Iron Man's metal suit is definitely very cool  equipped with about anything you'd need to fight an army of terrorists  or anyone else. The suit - and his super pacemaker - turn him into a Superman-type guy in that he can fly pretty high and pretty high. The latter part - how high he could fly - makes a nice conclusion  by the way  regarding the good guy's battle against the ""bad Iron Man.""",positive

But at the same time perfect in a certain sensibility of entertainment for its audience. One should know what Tony Stark's as a character not exactly the usual 'with great power come great response-yada-yada-yada' thing. He has a more jaded attitude  slightly more cynical than your typical man-of-steel (wait  sorry  iron  or alloy as it is). I'm almost reminded a little of Bill Murray from Ghostbusters  only with the catch of him being like Bruce Wayne without the grieving dead parents aspect.He has lots of money  lots of technical know-how as a wonder-kid/multi-millionaire  and he drinks and gambles and sleeps with whomever he wants. We as the audience don't identify with him as average Joe- some of us would want to be him for all the hedonistic perks available. And  when the time comes  he can whip up a technological breakthrough under the most dire of circumstances (i.e. under pressure of death to make a weapon for terrorists and instead making his quintessential suit).But at the same time  when Tony Stark becomes Iron Man  he does have a level of conscience from the start  realizing that the company that is under his name (if not one he entirely runs) has been manufacturing big-time weapons of mass mayhem (dont want to put destruction in there  though it's pretty much that)  and wants to not want this any longer. Instead  basically  he takes matters into his own hands as some fantastical figure; instead of some army to take out insurgent terrorists in Afghanistan  he'll come and wipe em out in a jiffy. In this sense it's pure escapism  but also hitting on current issues (in the comic books it was similar terrain with him practically taking out Vietcong every which way). True  it might be much to imagine  but in the realm of a comic book movie  where we're already on the train of massive entertainment and being along for the ride of this character who can do what he does because he's that damn good.It's a thrill-ride  and it's very funny for much of the running time. And not unintentionally so like in  for example  Ghost Rider. It's genuinely hysterical to see certain things that make sense for Stark but are still wildly over the top in delicious ways (i.e. the strippers on the plane  yeah you read that right)  or in just little things with how Robert Downey Jr. plays it. And make no mistake  this is pretty much a textbook example of perfect casting for a tricky character like this to cast. You want the charisma and appeal of a leading man  but can he also have something to him that speaks of the moral ambivalence and seedier bits to the character? You can't do it with a George Clooney  but with Downey Jr. it's a match made in not-guilty-pleasure heaven. He's able to bring the audience for the ride as a strong hero  but also hint at the fact that he's playing this character for what he is  and not cheating or skipping around the edges. Without him  it wouldn't work anywhere near as well.But to give director Favreau some more credit where it's due  also should be noted the near coup of casting Jeff Bridges as the villain - and as a character who is  basically  the ""anti-dude"" as it were - a dastardly figure who runs all of the shady dealings of Stark Industries and reveals his hand at wanting total domination of Stark's technology for his own means. His is a performance to relish among the great comic-book villain turns. But also noteworthy are supporting players: Gwyneth Paltrow  where'd she come from for this part that works this well? Terence Howard as well  and a couple of other supporting parts  they all seem to click just as well.Which brings me to the director  who should get credit where it's certainly due; coming from work as an actor/writer  going up through Made  Elf  and the recent bomb Zathura  it's a remarkable achievement to pull this kind of work off. While it goes without saying the script is already set for him to go  he doesn't tinker with it or his style to make it any more aggressively stylish than it needs to be. His is slick  efficient film-making  and even with witty moments to match up the bigger audience laughs (watch how he keeps the camera still through the POV of the lens Stark has up filming his botched 'test' in his rockets). For all the praise that Downey (very rightfully) will get for his work here  Favreau's is probably just as noteworthy in mixing rousing thrills and blockbuster entertainment and action while shamelessly delivering on the cynical side of the story. Just the final line  and how its delivered and in the context  is worth the price of admission.Oh  and by the way  stay through the end credits. If you're geeky about anything Iron Man (or awesome actors in eye-patches)  you'll leave with a huge grin from ear to ear.",positive

That said  this was a pretty cool action movie directed by Jon Favreau with some subtle humor shoehorned in courtesy of Robert Downey  Jr. as Stark and Gwyneth Paltrow as his associate Pepper Potts. What a nicely romantic team they play here! While there's also Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges to fill up the capable supporting cast  I must mention Clark Gregg as a SHIELD agent who has his own amusing moments in his brief scenes with Ms. Paltrow. He's a regular on ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"". There's great drama in Afganistan and plenty of kick-butt action in whatever city this movie takes place in that I was wholly enthralled the whole way through. With a sequel already being planned  I wholly look forward to the next adventures of Iron Man! P.S. Check out Stan Lee being mistaken for Hugh Hefner here.",positive

It doesn't take much to realize that Bridges has his own agenda in this film and that he is up to absolutely no good whatsoever.The kids will love the special affects here  especially the fight between the two robots (Downey and Bridges) on that bridge near the film's end.,positive

I think it is not as good as the ratings suggest. The pacing is incredibly slow for a fantasy action hero movie. It's well over 30 minutes and Stark is still developing the suit! The plot is not very engaging either  it is not exciting enough. The characters are poorly developed too. I do not find myself care for any of the characters  except maybe Stark. Poor Gwyneth Paltrow  she is such a supporting character in here  and her role could be played by anyone. Action scenes are sparse and short  and not exciting at all. The subplot about battles in Afghanistan feels more like an oppositional political propaganda  rather than the story actually needs. ""Iron Man"" needs a script rewrite and a much tighter editing to make it more thrilling.",negative

You say that Robert Downey Jr is just not the super hero type...get over it. He plays Tony Stark the billionaire industrialist  who manufactures superior weapons of war. Stark is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan with the promise of freedom if he builds a highly destructive missile for them. Instead he builds a suit of armor to make his escape. Stark realizes that many of his weapons are being used to kill Americans in combat. He holds a press conference expounding his manufacturing empire will quit the production of weapons. He puts a lot of effort in perfecting his armored suit to turn himself into the highly technological hero Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his faithful personal assistant Pepper Potts. Terrence Howard is his jet pilot friend James Rhodes. And his mentor and business partner Obadiah Stane(Jeff Bridges) is the essence of evil covertly ordering a hit to kill Stark and take over his empire. Also in the cast: Faran Tahir  Sayed Badreya  Shaun Toub and the gorgeous Leslie Bibb. FX and CGI are commanding and superb. You really get the bang for your buck. The film's stars have already signed on to do two sequels.,positive
